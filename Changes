Revision history for dvd::rip 0.47 and newer. See Changes.0.46
for older releases.

0.48.1 Sat 23 Nov 2002, joern
	Note:
	- transcode 0.6.2 was released on 22. November. dvd::rip
	  works with all 0.6 releases, but 0.6.2 is recommended.
	  dvd::rip disables some features for smaller versions.
	
	Features:
	- Added 64 kbit/s audio bitrate preset entry. Suggested by
	  Miguel J. Jimenez <cactus_espinado AT yahoo.es>
	- ffmpeg video codec setting adjusted to the new ffmpeg
	  interface of transcode 0.6.2. Thanks for the hint to
	  Stefano <stefano AT symbola.it>
	- subtitleripper version is now checked, a correspondent
	  note is printed, if a version smaller than 0.3 is detected.
	  Arne Driescher build a transcode independent tarball
	  of this release, which you can get from Sourceforge:
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleripper

	Bugfixes:
	- Burning tab: label information followed file selection only
	  on the GUI, but old values were used internally.
	- IFO file copying didn't work for DVD image projects. Thanks
	  for the report to Arne Driescher.
	- thranduil <thranduil AT free.fr> reported that dvd::rip's
	  vcdimager command works only with long options. I can't
	  reproduce this, but I switched over to the long options,
	  just to be sure.

0.48.0 Sun 17 Nov 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- transcode 0.6.2.20021114 is the recommended version for
	  this release. 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 still work, but dvd::rip
	  lacks features with them, e.g. subtitle support.
	- From 0.47.06 on dvd::rip needs to know the mount point of your
	  DVD device. So open the preferences dialog and enter your
	  mount point there. Also the DVD must be mountable by the
	  user who executes dvd::rip.
	- File format changed slightly with 0.47.02, but is backward
	  compatible. dvd::rip prints a short message when converting
	  an older file to the new format.
	- Version numbering changes with this release. It follows
	  the common MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme. Two branches are
	  distuingished using the MINOR number: the stable branch
	  uses even numbers, the unstable odd. So the next stable
	  release is 0.50.0, bugfixes on 0.48.0 will be numbered 
	  0.48.1, 0.48.2 etc and the next unstable branch is 0.49.1,
	  0.49.2 etc.
	- Read all change log entries of 0.47 to see what changed
	  in detail since 0.46.

	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a "division by zero" bug on Clip & Zoom tab.
	- Subtitles: test transcoding threw an exception, if no
	  preview images were grabbed. Reported by Andreas Lemke.

0.47.12 Wed 13 Nov 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Changing mp2 bitrate threw an exception. Thanks for the report
	  to Andreas Lemke <andreas.lemke AT epost.de>
	- Transcoding failed, if no subtitles were detected. Also
	  reported by Andreas Lemke.
	- Message about wrong transcode version on the subtitle tab
	  was too big, the project window needed to grow for it.

0.47.11 Tue 12 Nov 2002, joern
	Note:
	- Actual transcode pre-0.6.2 snapshots have a bug in cluster
	  mode, which destroys A/V sync, while transcode 0.6.1 works
	  fine. The next transcode snapshot should fix that issue.
	  Until that happens I suggest using 0.6.1 for cluster
	  operation.
      
	Features:
	- Reorganized the video options widgets on the transcode tab
	  a bit. Makes more sense now, in my opinion.
	- Menu entry "Operate/Create dvdrip-info file" (dvdrip-info
	  file is by default created when you start transcoding).
	- Information about subtitles added to the dvdrip-info file.

	Bugfixes:
	- The subtitle grabbing frame/timecode entry rejected
	  timecode values.
	- Autoadjust presets failed, when the movie had unusual
	  frame sizes (mostly this happened, if the preview frame
	  was a bad choice, e.g. it's mostly black. Then letterbox
	  detection didn't work properly and dvd::rip's autoadjust
	  mechanism bailed out).
	- Subtitle sort order in selection popup was alphanumeric.
	- Subtitle preview grabbing still didn't work if the
	  selection popup wasn't touched after ripping.
	- Pressing the "Scan volume" button did nothing if the
	  title wasn't ripped, instead of telling the user, *that*
	  the title isn't ripped ;) Thanks for the report to
	  Chris Jensen <chris AT drspirograph.com>.
	- Cluster mode:
	  - Nodes stopped by hand, didn't get online anymore
	    after starting them again.
	  - Nodes' "stopped" state wasn't restored properly in
	    case of a dvdrip-master restart.

0.47.10 Wed 06 Nov 2002, joern
	Features:
	- DVD mounting only for copying the IFO files, not for TOC
	  reading and ripping. Because the mount may make problems
	  (if your system isn't configured properly), this reduces
	  the harm a bit, because only the IFO files will be missing.
	  This affects vobsub subtitle generation only, everything
	  else will work as usual.

	Bugfixes:
	- IFO file copying didn't work, if the DVD wasn't mounted
	  already.
	- Fractional volume rescale values were rejected. Thanks for
	  the report to Laurent Grawet.

0.47.09 Fri 01 Nov 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Spaces in the frame range entries produced illegal transcode
	  options. Reported by Andrea Carpani <ancarpan AT tiscalinet.it>.
	- All entry fields are now syntax checked (e.g. non-digits
	  are rejected when a number is expected).
	- When ripping multiple titles or chapters, dvd::rip calculated
	  6 GB x (number of titles/chapters) as the assumed disk space,
	  instead of assuming 6 GB once. Reported by Michel Alexandre
	  Salim.
	- Cancelling a rip after a disk usage warning didn't set
	  the ripping GUI sensitive again.
	- Cluster mode: switch node state from offline to online after
	  a 20 second delay (a booting machine answeres ping requests
	  some time before the ssh daemon is up - this way the system
	  has 20 seconds to start the ssh daemon after starting the
	  network; this should suffice). Requested by Matthias Kukuk
	  <m.kukuk AT gmx.de>
	- AC3 audio tab was always active, even if the selected audio
	  channel was no AC3.
	- Ripping didn't work, when the DVD wasn't mounted by the user
	  before.

0.47.08 Wed 30 Oct 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a typo which breaks subtitle transcoding. Thanks to
	  Paul Gohn <pgohn AT nexgo.de> for the report and
	  William Hawkins <whawkins AT vt.edu> for the fix.

0.47.07 Tue 29 Oct 2002, joern
	Features:
	- Added another RPM spec file RedHat-Rawhide-Video-DVDRip.spec.
	  Sorry for my ignorance, but I don't understand anything of
	  RPM spec files and don't why or whether they are really distro
	  specific or not. I just add them, if I get them. This one
	  was sent by Ragnar Kjørstad <dvdrip AT ragnark.vestdata.no>.
	  Thanks.

	Bugfixes:
	- The "dvd mount point" check in the preferences dialog didn't
	  work reliably with all distributions, so I dropped it (resp.
	  the existence of the mount point is checked only). Thanks
	  to Douglas Bollinger for the report.
	- dvd::rip now checks the mount state of the DVD reliably
	  and really mounts the DVD only, if it isn't mounted yet
	  (considering automounters, which were problematic). Thanks
	  to Davide Ferrari for the bug report.

0.47.06 Mon 28 Oct 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- From now on dvd::rip needs to know the mount point of your
	  DVD device. So open the preferences dialog and enter your
	  mount point there. Also the DVD must be mountable by the
	  user who executes dvd::rip.
	- To get vobsub support you must re-read the TOC from your DVD.
	  (which nukes your settings of the project - sorry, but it's
	   a beta release).

	Features:
	- Subtitles: dvd::rip now creates vobsub files, which can be
	  played with mplayer, using Arne Driescher's subtitle2vobsub.
	  Splitting is considered, you get one vobsub per splitted file.
	  You can create the vobsub by pressing the appropriate button
	  on the Subtitle tab, or by checking "Create later after
	  transcoding". Chapter mode isn't supported. Cluster mode support
	  will follow (you can start vobsub creation from dvd::rip's
	  Operate menu after transcoding with the cluster). A .rar file is
	  created, if rar is present on your system. You need a recent
	  mplayer (I use 0.90pre9) to play rar-vobsub files. Attention:
	  your rar binary *must not* be newer than 2.x (3.x isn't
	  supported by mplayer; I use rar 2.71 with success here).
	  It's hard to find such an old version, so you can grab it
	  from here: http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin
	  Thanks to Arne for the hint about rar-vobsub and again for
	  his great subtitleripper package. You can play a vobsub with
	  these mplayer options:

	  mplayer -vobsub movie-001-sid02 movie-001.avi

	  (In this example the vosub file(s) are "movie-001-sid02.rar"
	   resp. "movie-001-sid02.{ifo,sub,idx}")

	- IFO files: dvd::rip copies the .ifo files into the project's
	  tmp/ifo directory when reading the TOC.
	- Disc size popup became a combo box, so you can enter arbitrary
	  disc sizes (for customized splitting, e.g. if you want to
	  leave space for other stuff, you want to put on the CD's).
	- dvd::rip prints a warning message if you use RH 8.0 without
	  the PERLIO=stdio environment variable set. Requested by
	  Michael Mason <mgm AT eskimoman.net>. NEEDS TESTING, please
	  report to dvdrip-user, whether this works!

	Bugfixes:
	- transcode supports rendering subtitles only with -x vob, that
	  means I had to switch off rendering support for on-the-fly
	  and dvd-image-ripping. Creating vobsub's work for all modes.
	- Subtitle grabbing didn't work for titles which have only one
	  subtitle, or if you never explicetely selected a subtitle from
	  the popup. You must re-read the TOC for the fix to take effect.
	  Thanks to Michèl Alexandre Salim for the extensive bug report.
	- When ripping on-thy-fly or from an DVD image, the "Rip" button
	  is disabled instead of alter it to a "Volume scan" button.
	  Volume scanning can be done on the Transcode tab, so this function
	  is rather confusing on the Rip tab.
	- When zoom width/height were empty, dvd::rip produced illegal
	  fast resizing transcode options.
	- CD burning: list of files was refreshed when entering the
	  transcode tab instead of the burn tab.
	- dvd::rip crashed on first startup, when no ~/.dvdriprc file
	  was present. Thanks to Davide Ferarri for the detailed report.

0.47.05 Wed 16 Oct 2002, joern
	Features:
	- Extensive support for rendering subtitles on the movie
	  (creating vobsub files is prepared, not yet implemented
	  but coming soon). Subtitle stuff is on its own tab, documentation
	  will follow. You need at least transcode 0.6.2.20021010 for this
	  to work. For existent projects you must re-read the DVD TOC,
	  because subtitle-detection is done here. Also you need a recent
	  CVS version of subtitle2pgm from Arne Driescher's subtitleripper
	  package. You can find it on his project homepage:
	  
	  http://subtitleripper.sourceforge.net/
	  
	  If you're unfamilar with CVS: I put a snapshot together of the
	  version I'm currently using. You can find it here:

	  http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/subtitleripper-20021015.tgz

	  Thanks a lot to Arne, who added some features on my request
	  to make it work seamlessly with dvd::rip.
          dvd::rip's subtitle support isn't finished yet, a few things
	  could be improved, e.g. the suggestion functions should be
	  capable of addding black bars in the clip1 stage or addding black
	  bars in clip2 for 4:3 movies etc. Stay tuned.
	- When transcoding a .dvdrip-info file is generated, which
	  contains some interesting technical information about the
	  created movie file. Thanks to Moritz Bunkus for this
	  suggestion.
	- Use a notebook for the different audio codecs supported by
	  dvd::rip, instead of struggling around with making widgets
	  sensitive when possible. This makes things much clearer and
	  is more flexible, because audio options can differ much more,
	  depending on the selected codec. Also pages of codecs, which
	  aren't supported with the current settings, are hided instead
	  of making them unsensitive.
	- DVD audio popup now shows "=> skip" for audio tracks, which
	  are not selected for transcoding. I had some reports of users
	  regarding wrong transcoded audio channels, but in fact they
	  missed activating the desired audio track correctly. I hope
	  such misunderstandings don't happen anymore now.
	- Status bar shows free disk space, when idle.
	- Free disk space is checked before starting a job which
	  needs some. dvd::rip currently doesn't know in advance
	  how much space a ripped title will need. As a thumb rule
	  dvd::rip warns if less than 6GB are available. Space
	  checking applies to standard mode only, not cluster mode.
	- After an intensive mailing list discussion about the correct
	  file extension for OGG files containing video tracks
	  (.ogg vs .ogm), I yielded to Roland Seuhs arguments and
	  decided that .ogm is now the default file extension for OGG
	  files. You can change this in the preference dialog, if you
	  prefer .ogg (or an arbitrary different file extension...)
	- CD burning / cdrdao command: if the configured cdrdao command
	  contains the 'write' option already, dvd::rip doesn't add
	  it again. This way you can provide specific cdrdao options.
	  (cdrdao expects 'write' as the first parameter). Thanks
	  to Christian Herrmann <paras.rasmatazz AT t-online.de> for
	  the hint 
	- Added a rpmspecs/ folder in the distribution, which currently
	  contains RPM spec files for SuSE 8.0 and RedHat 8.0. I doesn't
	  maintain all of these files personally, e.g. version numbers
	  may be outdated or something like that. But I hope they are
	  useful anyway. Thanks to Michèl Alexandre Salim <salimma1
	  AT yahoo.co.uk>, who provided the RedHat and to Rainer Lay
	  Lay for the SuSE file.

	Bugfixes:
	- Clip&Zoom video preview command did not appear in the
	  logfile. Thanks to Michael Bushey for the report.
	- Not enough: Clip&Zoom video preview didn't even work from
	  ripped VOB's. Same report by Michael Bushey.
	- Add. transcode options weren't passed through when
	  transcoding audio for multiple audio tracks (e.g. -D to
	  correct A/V sync mismatch). Thanks to Clint Silvester
	  <clint AT focuscompanies.com> for his report.
	- Clipping didn't work if clip entries were empty (which
	  should be interpreted as 0 instead). Reported by Michael
	  Bushey.
	- Audio size calculation on transcode tab wasn't correct
	  (calculated base 1024 instead 1000), but the correct value
	  was used for video bitrate calculation.
	- When changing from mp3 to vorbis dvd::rip automatically
	  choose vorbis for additional tracks on the GUI, but this
	  wasn't stored internally, so generated transcode commands
	  still had mp3 options. Reported by edaniel <edaniel AT
	  perso.mine.nu>.
	- Titles with no target audio track threw an exception in
	  cluster mode. As long as the cluster doesn't support this,
	  dvd::rip prevents adding such a title to a cluster. Reported
	  by Rainer Lay.

0.47.04 Sun 6 Oct 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- On the fly CD burning didn't work (fortunately without
	  destroying the CD...).
	- Updated RPM spec file which now considers pstree for
	  standard mode.
	
0.47.03 Sun 6 Oct 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- dvd::rip now generally depends on 'pstree' not only in
	  cluster mode
	- Red Hat 8.0's Perl distribution has a bug regarding
	  pipes using non-blocking I/O. dvd::rip doesn *not* work
	  with RH 8.0 due to this. Refer to the news entry 2002/10/06
	  on http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/ for details.

	Features:
	- Simple CD burning facility. Supports ISO, VCD2 and SVCD
	  types. Needs mkisofs, cdrecord for ISO operation and
	  vcdimager, cdrdao for (S)VCD operation.
	  All commands can and must be configured in the global
	  preferences. cdrecord and cdrdao must be able to operate
	  as a normal user resp. the user who executes dvd::rip.
	  cdrecord must either be set-uid-root or executed through
	  xcdrwrap from an existent xcdroast installation. cdrdao
	  must be set-uid-root or the CD burner device file must
	  be writable by the user who executes dvd::rip.
	  Warning: currently *no* special checking beside existence
	  of the needed tools is done, so use this on your own risk.
	  Try burning in "test mode" first. I tested this with
	  * cdrecord 1.11a31
	  * cdrdao 1.1.5
	  * mkisofs 1.15a29
	  * vcdimager 0.7.12
	  and don't know if other versions work, too.
	- Debugging window shows CD burning commands for the selected
	  file entries.
	- Global preferences now splitted into several pages of
	  a notebook widget. Added a simple checking of the specified
	  values, e.g. if the DVD device and default project directory
	  are writable, or if specified tools exist.
	- New preference: ogg file extension. Suggested by Moritz Bunkus.
	  dvd::rip defauls to '.ogg', but you can switch to '.ogm' or
	  arbitrary extensions, if this makes using the files more
	  comfortable for you.
	- Added a rpm spec file Video-DVDRip.spec, so you can simply
	  build a .rpm archive from the .tar.gz using 
	  > rpm -ta Video-DVDRip-0.XX.tar.gz
	  Thanks to Rainer Ley for the spec file template.
	- Button "Nuke log file" on logging tab, which resets the
	  log file.
	- dvd::rip now opens the preferences dialog, if no ~/.dvdriprc
	  is found resp. on first startup.

	Bugfixes:
	- PSU core setting was ignored when adding add. audio-tracks,
	  reported by Lethal Weapon <lethalwp AT tiscali.be>
	- Window title was not cleared, if a project was closed,
 	  reported by Fabio Russo

0.47.02 Mon 30 Sep 2002, joern
	Note:
	- File format changed slightly, but is backward compatible.
	  dvd::rip prints a short message when converting an older
	  file to the new format.

	Features:
	- Experimental OGG/Vorbis audio support. If you choose
	  Vorbis as an audio codec, the result will be a .ogm
	  file with DivX/Xvid/whatever video and Vorbis audio
	  (so this implicetely switches the resulting file container
	  format from AVI to OGG - which will become an explicite
	  option, once OGG support is more complete).

	  Splitting is supported. Cluster mode support available only
	  for movies with one PSU. Movies with more than one PSU will be
	  supported when ogmtools provide a program for concatenating
	  OGG streams. Multiple audio tracks are supported, but you
	  currently can't mix mp3/ac3/vorbis codecs for the same title.
	  (mp3/ac3 is supported by ogmtools, but without A/V sync).
	  You need ogmtools 0.950 and transcode 0.6.1 for the whole
	  thing to work. You can get ogmtools here:
	  
	  http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/index.html
	  
	  Thanks to Moritz Bunkus for writing ogmtools and answering
	  my questions.

	- when opening a project file, dvd::rip now selects
	  automatically the tab which was selected when the file
	  was saved.
	- new dvdrip command line options "-f {transcode|transcode_split}"
	  and "-t title-nr" to select a title of a given project file
	  on startup and transcode (and optionally split) it.
	  dvd::rip exits after finishing, so this can be used for
	  simple batch transcoding a bunch of projects/titles, if
	  cluster mode is no option for you (e.g. in case of NTSC movies).
	  Thanks to Rainer Lay for his suggestion.

	  Example: dvdrip -t 1 -f transcode_split movie.rip

	Bugfixes:
	- Cluster mode: if a frame range was set, dvdrip-master
	  crashed with a fatal error (transcoding a frame range
	  is still not supported with cluster mode, but really no
	  need for dvdrip-master to crash here... ;)

0.47.01 Sun 29 Sep 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Progress information was messed up when transcoding
	  chapters from a DVD image or when doing direct DVD
	  transcoding. Because dvd::rip can't know the chapter
	  length in advance in this case, now no progress information
	  is printed (no percent/eta), only fps and elapsed time.
	  Thanks to David Rosky <d_rosky AT nccn.net> for his
	  detailed bug report.
	- Chapter mode: ripping progress is related to the length
	  of the title, what is confusing if not all chapters are
	  selected. For single chapter ripping now no percent/eta
	  progress is printed anymore. Reported by David Rosky.
	- Cluster mode: node test didn't work (stalled). Thanks for
	  the report to Fabio Russo <f.russo AT anthesia.it>.
