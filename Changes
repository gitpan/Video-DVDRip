Revision history and release notes for dvd::rip.

0.50.3 [stable branch] Mon 17 Feb 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Dropped the pstree dependend stuff completely. Now ps
	  is used, using Posix conform options only, so this should
	  work on most systems without problems.
	- Thanks to Ron Smits, who reported a problem with a few
	  zombie processes per dvd::rip session on a Slackware system.
	  After about an hour of IRC chatting we found a solution
	  for it ;)
	
0.50.2 [stable branch] Sat 15 Feb 2003, joern
	Features:
	- Some layout optimizations: squeezed the GUI again a bit
	  and the preview images are now slightly bigger.

	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a typo in SVCD transcode command. Reported by
	  several users.
	- Cancellation of some tasks left processes over. Changed
	  back to old cancellation method, which depends on
	  pstree, so this is now listed "mandatory" in the dependency
	  window. Reported by Fridtjof Busse <fridtjof AT fbunet.de>.
	- Depend check didn't check for absolute path of
	  /usr/sbin/fping. Also reported by Fridtjof Busse.
	- Cancellation of a vobsub PS1 extraction left files over,
	  so further vobsub PS1 extraction didn't work. Thanks for
	  the report to Gregorio Guidi <g.guidi AT sns.it>.
	- Changed two internal Perl namespaces, which confused the
	  CPAN/PAUSE Perl module indexer.

0.50.1 [stable branch] Tue 11 Feb 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- NTSC VCD film encoding (at 23.976) didn't work. Thanks for
	  the report to Chris Elston <celston AT corky.sapien.net>.
	- dvd::rip's main window was too tall for standard desktops
	  with 1024x768 resolution. I could save some space within
	  the "Calculated storage" frame to fix this. On my system the
	  window has now 657x696 pixels, which should be Ok for
	  1024x768 desktops. Thanks for the report to Florin.
	- Subtitle selection wasn't activated, even if subtitle2pgm
	  was detected correctly.

0.50.0 [stable branch] Mon 10 Feb 2003, joern
	Notes:
	- This is a new stable release, closing the 0.49.x unstable
	  branch.
	- Project file format changed since 0.48.x. Older files are
	  converted automatically, but you can't use files saved with
	  this release with older dvd::rip versions.
	- You should use at least transcode 0.6.3 to get all new features,
	  but transcode 0.6.2 is still supported.
	- To get full and bugfree support for the new Filter & Preview
	  feature, read the entry of 0.49.11 and apply the patch mentioned
	  there, unless you have transcode > 0.6.3 (which doesn't exist
	  as of this writing).
	- From now on dvd::rip insists on Perl >= 5.6.0.
	- For a full list of changes and bugfixes, refer to the 0.49.x
	  change log entries below. Features and bugfixes listed next
	  are changes to 0.49.13.

	Features:
	- New button "Check all settings" in Preference dialog.
	  Suggested by Ole Tange.

	Bugfixes:
	- Dependencies listed ogmtools with minimum 0.954, but correct
	  is 0.960 (mp3/ac3 only works since this version).
	- Dependency check didn't consider maximum rar version (must be
	  a 2.x version, no 3.x).
	- Filter removal didn't affect an opened preview window.
	- Negative values in the cropping entries were rejected. Thanks
	  for the report to Mauro Spluga <ferluga AT inwind.it>

0.49.13 [unstable branch] Sat 08 Feb 2003, joern
	Features:
	- A more sophisticated dependency check. A new window (menu item
	  "Debug/Check dependencies") lists all needed tools with
	  minimum, suggested and installed version numbers. On startup
	  dvd::rip opens this window with a corresponding error message,
	  if a mandatory tool is missing. Optional modules are disabled,
	  if the correspondent tool isn't installed (affects subtitles,
	  (S)VCD, OGG/Vorbis and CD burning).
	- Filter & preview: an activated subtitle rendering (from the
	  Subtitle page) is passed through, so this is a better option to
	  test your subtitle settings - compared to the slow test
	  transcoding facility on the Subtitle page.
	- PSU core is enabled by default only for NTSC movies which
	  have more than one PSU. Thanks for this suggestion to Florin.
	- Full volume scanning support in chapter mode. A patch from
	  Kianusch Sayah Karadji.

	Bugfixes:
	- Filter preview: transcode has to be started with -u 1,
	  otherwise pause/undo jumps between different frames. Thanks
	  to Tilmann for the hint.
	- Enabled nice for all cluster jobs (was enabled only for video
	  transcoding). Reported by Michael Dratz <midra AT web.de>.
	- A uncaught exception was thrown, if dvd::rip couldn't connect
	  to a remote cluster master daemon. Reported by Fabio Russo.

0.49.12 [unstable branch] Thu 06 Feb 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Reading TOC threw an exception, reported by Tilmann.
	- Opening a filter preview frame with a freshly ripped
	  title segfaulted transcode, because the preview buffer
	  size was empty. Now it's 20 by default.
	- Stopping a paused preview window didn't close the window.
	
0.49.11 [unstable branch] Thu 06 Feb 2003, joern
	Note:
	- Filter & Preview enabled only for transcode >= 0.6.3 stable.

	Features:
	- Added a warning message about non-standard (S)VCD frame sizes.
	- SVCD video framerate is now limited to a maximum of 2600
	  (overall bitrate as supplied before is limited to 2748).
	- Added Open/Close DVD/Burner tray buttons on Title and Burn pages.
	  Based on a patch from Kianusch Sayah Karadji <kianusch AT
	  sk-tech.net>. You need to configure your "burner device" in the
	  Preferences and must have the 'eject' command installed on your
	  system.
	- Special support for logo, logoaway and mask filters: you
	  can select a rectangular area on the preview window and
	  the corresponding position / size values are automatically
	  filled into the entries on the GUI. For PRE filters (currently
	  mask only), the coordinates are transformed correctly - needed
	  because the preview window shows the POST result, while the
	  filter expects PRE coordinates (prior clipping and resizing).
	  Also in YUV mode dvd::rip takes care, that the values are even.
	- File selection dialog for filename filter options.
	- YUV is automatically disabled, if you have a filter which
	  supports RGB only (indeed, currently all transcode filters
	  support YUV) or if you crop or resize with odd values.
	  So now there is no need for the "YUV internal" checkbox to
	  come back.
	- Filter preview loops, if end of the movie or frame range
	  is reached.
	- Applying filters in pause mode enabled again - also the "Undo"
	  button is back. You need transcode 0.6.3 with this patch
	  from Tilmann: (to be applied on vanilla 0.6.3)
          http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/patches/tc-0.6.3-preview-pause.patch
		% cd transcode-0.6.3
		% patch -p1 < tc-0.6.3-preview-pause.patch
	- Multiple instances of the same filter are now fully supported.

	Bugfixes:
	- VCD Clip&Zoom presets didn't produce correct aspect ratio.
	  Thanks for the hint to Simone Lehmann <simone AT lisanet.de>.
	- Quotes in the project name resp. project paths confuse
	  dvd::rip. The path fields on the storage page now reject
	  a bunch of special characters, as a first bugfix. Thanks for
	  the report to Spencer Ogden <spencero AT mail.utexas.edu>.
	- Added mpeg2enc options "-I 0 -p" for NTSC 23.976 fps movies,
	  because otherwise A/V sync is messy. Thanks for the hint
	  to Andrew Ukrainec <ukrainec AT sympatico.ca>.
	- Closing the "Configure filter" window when a preview
	  window was playing, didn't close the preview window
	  also.
	- PSU core disabled for filter preview, because the generated
	  transcode command doesn't work with it. Thanks for the
	  report to Douglas Bollinger.
	- GUI for filters with no options (e.g. dilyuvmmx) was messed up.
	- Changing some filter frame range options didn't work.
	- Some legal fractional values were rejected by dvd::rip's
	  value check module.
	- Fixed a typo on the burning page. Thanks to Yves Duret
	  <yves AT zarb.org>.

0.49.10 [unstable branch] Tue 28 Jan 2003, joern
	Features:
	- transcode filter description cache is automatically
	  refreshed not only when transcode was updated, but
	  also when the corresponding dvd::rip module changed.

	Bugfixes:
	- A broken .dvdriprc file could crash dvd::rip with a
	  confusing error message. Now a better error message
	  is printed, which suggests to remove the broken file.
	- Filter & Preview:
	  - Options of 'logo' filter were not recognized correctly.
	    Reported by Tilmann.
	  - Adding 'logoaway' filter threw an exception. In general
	    some filters with checkbox options didn't work correctly.
	    Also reported by Tilmann.
	  - Parameter passing for filter options with multiple values
	    didn't work.
	  - Broken filter default setting parser removed. Now
	    String::Scanf is used, which is copied into dvd::rip's
	    library tree, to keep the dependencies low.
	  - transcode currently doesn't support reliably to apply filter
	    changes in paused mode, so this isn't possible on the GUI
	    anymore. The "Undo" button became useless due to that, so it
	    was also removed. Now everything that's possible, should
	    work as expected ;)
	  - Closing the preview window now works and stops the
	    corresponding transcode process cleanly.
	    Note: you need to patch your transcode for that. Download
            http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/patches/tc-20030123-preview-close.patch
	    (from Tilmann) and and apply it with
		% cd transcode-0.6.3-20030123
		% patch -p1 < tc-20030123-preview-close.patch
	    Any newer snapshot as 0.6.3-20030123 should have that
	    patch included, soon. Older unpatched versions show the
	    same erroneous behaviour - so don't close the preview
	    window with them and use the 'O' button instead.

0.49.9 [unstable branch] Mon 27 Jan 2003, joern
	Features:
	- A new experimental dialog "Configure filters". All filters
	  supported by transcode's new socket interface are available
	  here for configuration. You need at least transcode 0.6.3.20030123
	  for it. But it's not only a comprehensive configuration
	  dialog - you have a live preview window and can check your
	  changes in realtime WYSIWYG - it's really cool, guys. Thanks
	  to Tilmann, who implemented the transcode part and send me
	  patches immediately after my bug reports ;) Currently there
	  is no documentation, hopefully the GUI is somewhat self-
	  explanatory. Nevertheless: a short quick start guide:
	  - click "Configure filters & preview" on the transcode page
	  - double click on the "invert" filter in the left filter list
	  - click on the ">" (Play) Button
	  - a preview window opens, showing the movie inverted
	  - disable the "Enable filter" checkbox
	  - click on "A" (Apply) - the movie immediately gets
	    normal again
	  - any filter setting changes can be applied in realtime
	    by clicking on the "A" button at any time.
	  - click on the "||" (Pause) button
	  - now you can navigate through transcode's internal preview
	    buffer (you can modify the size of this buffer with the
	    first entry in the "Preview settings" frame). "<<" and ">>"
	    navigate by frame, "<<<" and ">>>" usually by 5 frames
	    (resp. higher values for higher buffer sizes). You get green
	    frames, if you access parts of the buffer, which aren't
	    filled yet.
	  - in pause mode:
	    - change a filter setting
	    - click on "A" (Apply)
	    - the current picture is rendered with the new setting
	    - now click on "U" (Undo)
	    - the picture before you applied the last time is restored.
	      This way you easily can compare two filter settings.
	    - (see note about this in the "Known bugs" section beyond).
	  - the preview window runs with maximum speed. You can slow
	    done resp. speed up again using the "-" and "+" buttons.
	  - click on "O" (Stop) to close the preview window
	- Dropped "Antialias" setting on transcode page. It's seldom
	  used and you still can enable it using the new filters
	  dialog (videocore filter, -C option).
	- Progress information for chapter ripping. dvd::rip uses
	  dvdxchap, which is part of ogmtools, to get the chapter
	  lengths. If you don't have ogmtools installed, dvd::rip
	  falls back to the old bevhaviour showing no ripping progress
	  for chapters.

	Known bugs:
	- For some reasons the pp filter doesn't work with the
	  filter configuration dialog. Have to debug this.
	- Just closing the preview window doesn't really stop the
	  process, you anyway must hit the stop button. Sometimes
	  you even must kill transcode processes by hand, if you
	  closed the preview window. Have to discuss this with Tilmann.
	- Multiple applying and undoing settings on a paused frame is
	  cumulative. Also a subject of discussion with Tilmann ;)
	- transcode supports adding some filters multiple times. Due
	  to a bug in transcode (or in dvd::rip - not figured out finally)
	  this doesn't work with transcode 0.6.3.20030123, so it's
	  disabled on dvd::rip's GUI until it works.
	
	Bugfixes:
	- Reduce disc size passed to avisplit/ogmsplit to decrease
	  the risk of a oversized file. Thanks to Felix Knecht
	  <felixknecht AT web.de> and Julio Sánchez for report and
	  discussion.
	- Adding (S)VCD projects to cluster using the menu entry
	  isn't possible anymore - (S)VCD is not supported by 
	  cluster mode. The corresponding button was disabled, but
	  the menu entry not.
	- Remove trailing whitespace from path's on the storage page.
	  This makes pasting from an xterm easier, if the buffer
	  contains a trailing newline. Requested by Tilmann Bitterberg.
	- Subtitle preview grabbing threw an exception.

0.49.8 [unstable branch] Mon 13 Jan 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Frame range "end" entry didn't work anymore. Christoph's
	  frame range patch of 0.49.7 was correct, but I applied an
	  erroneous "optimization" ;)
	- Fixed a typo: preset "SVCD 16:9 anamorph, PAL" actually is
	  "SVCD anamorph, PAL".

0.49.7 [unstable branch] Mon 13 Jan 2003, joern
	Notes:
	- From now on dvd::rip insists on Perl >= 5.6.0. Older
	  versions don't provide the syntactic sugar I like.
	- Added a COPYRIGHT file, with references to all developers
	  who contributed patches and share the copyright.

	Features:
	- Multiple audio track support for SVCD (you get a warning
	  if you select more than two tracks, because this isn't
	  standard conform).
	- A new checkbox "Use range" on the Transcode page enables
	  considerung a given frame range for video bitrate
	  calculation. This was implemented by Christoph Bartoschek
	  <bartoschek AT gmx.de>.
	- Single instance windows now pop up into foreground if
	  opened again. A patch from Matthias Riese.
	- DVD TOC occupies now all space available. Again a patch
	  from Matthias Riese.
	- Burn page filename list occupies now all space available.
	  Yet another a patch from Matthias Riese ;)

	Bugfixes:
	- Removed any conditional code for transcode versions < 0.6.2.
	  This fixed also a missing "--print_status 20" transcode
	  parameter, which increased video transcoding load
	  unnecessarily. Thanks for the report to Vlad Spichek
	  <spy AT mbox.ath.cx>.
	- According to a hint from Julio Sánchez mpeg2enc's -S
	  parameter is set to 10000 for non-splitting operation,
	  because mpeg2enc splits by default at 700 MB.
	- smartdeinter setting wasn't restored after opening a
	  project file. Reported by Christian Lambert.
	- Adjusted smartdeinter settings according to a suggestion
	  of Christian Lambert:
	  -J smartdeinter=threshold=10:Blend=1:diffmode=2:highq=1
	- Frame range: entering illegal ranges (start > end) is
	  prevented now. Thanks for the report to Christoph Bartoschek.
	- Most 'focus-out' handlers are 'changed' handlers again.
	  Transfering changes to the internal object data structure on
	  focus-out is confusing resp. sometimes user has to click
	  somewhere to trigger it explicitly. Reported by Florin Andrei.
	- Burning tab: some unusal named (S)VCD image files weren't
	  recognized correctly.
	- Preferences: ffmpeg4 preset became ffmpeg. Setting 'ffmpeg'
	  from preferences didn't set af6/ffmpeg codec to 'mpeg4'
	  automatically. Reported by Christian Lambert.
	- Added fail safe code for a possible "illegal by division by
	  zero" condition in bitrate calculator. Reported by Christoph
	  Bartoschek.
	- "View AVI" was too fuzzy regarding filename globbing (.mpg
	  files were included). Reported by Markus Dewerny.

0.49.6 [unstable branch] Tue 7 Jan 2003, joern
	Features:
	- New preference for DVDCSS_METHOD environment variable
	  (in the misc section) which may help solving libdvdcss
	  related problems.
	  Refer to http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/doc/ for
	  details about the possible values and their meanings.
	  Default value is 'title', which works well for me.
	  Thanks to Dan <ayahuasca AT internode.on.net> for this
	  suggestion.
	- WAV creation command now printed in the debugging window.

	Bugfixes:
	- WAV creation resulted in white noise for lpcm tracks.
	  Thanks for the report to Damien Covey <djcovey AT
	  softhome.net>.
	- WAV creation didn't worked for Chapter mode. Also reported
	  by Damien Covey.

0.49.5 [unstable branch] Mon 6 Jan 2003, joern
	Features:
	- rar command (for vobsub compression) is now configurable.
	  Suggested by Mikkel Mondrup Kristensen <mikkel AT tdx.dk>.

	Bugfixes:
	- CD size wasn't set in (S)VCD transcode command. Reported
	  by Markus Dewerny <dewerny AT web.de> and Dirk Aust
	  <dirk_aust AT gmx.de>.
	- Clip & Zoom: width and height of zoom/clip2 stages didn't
	  update correctly if no zoom was set. Thanks for the report
	  to Joakim Verona <joakim AT verona.se>.

0.49.4 [unstable branch] Wed 1 Jan 2003, joern
	Features:
	- WAV generation of the selected audio track. You find a
	  correspondent entry in the "Operate" menu. The file is
	  created in the project's avi/ directory. Requested by
	  Thibaut Cousin <cousin AT in2p3.fr> and Marc Dirix
	  <dirixmjm AT home.nl>. Thanks to Tillmann Bitterberg
	  <transcode AT tibit.org>, who posted the shortest transcode
	  command for this ;)
	- Percentage log messages of previous dvd::rip versions are
	  back again (disappeared accidentally some versions ago).
	  Requested by Fred Beondo <bl8206 AT mindspring.com>.

	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a typo on the transcode tab. Thanks to Jochen Puchalla
	  <mail AT puchalla-online.de>.
	- Spaces in directories / filenames (project base directory,
	  vob/avi/tmp etc.) are not allowed, because they make problems
	  with transcode and other tools. Thanks to David Legg
	  <david_legg AT tiscali.co.uk>.
	- Changing the project name resp. project path after reading TOC
	  isn't possible anymore, because this confuses dvd::rp, which
	  can't find the files anymore. Thanks to Fabio Russo.
	- Closing a new project after reading TOC didn't open a save
	  file dialog (because after TOC reading the project is saved
	  to tmp/backup.rip already).
	- Cluster mode: dvdrip-master ignored configured nodes as long
	  as no project ever was added to the cluster. Thanks for some
	  hard investigation work to Wolfgang Schricker <wols AT wols.org>.
	- Added a fail safe check in file conversion.
	
0.49.3 [unstable branch] Sun 29 Dec 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- File conversion didn't work for all older files, due to a bug
	  in the version comparison routine.

0.49.2 [unstable branch] Sun 29 Dec 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- File format changed and isn't backward compatible. Old project
	  files are autoconverted, but older dvd::rip versions can't open
	  files saved with this version.
	- dvd::rip insists on transcode 0.6.2 from now on.

	Features:
	- Major internal code cleanup, hopefully without introducing too
	  many bugs.
	- Added OGG/Vorbis video bitrate optimization. First all audio
	  tracks are transcoded, after that the real audio size is known
	  so the video bitrate can be adjusted accordingly. Correspondent
	  messages appear in the log. This works in standard and cluster
	  mode. Thanks to Moritz Bunkus, Markus Liebl and xercist for
	  suggestions and discussion.
	- PCM passthrough (for AVI only). Requested long time ago by
	  Jamie Manley <jamie AT homebrewcomputing.com> and xercist.
	- Support for transcode's smartdeinter deinterlacing filter. This
	  switches off YUV mode, because this filter supports only RGB
	  (it's rather slow but has good quality). Requested by Christian
	  Lambert, Florin Andrei and others.
	- Slightly cluster mode optimization: master node's state is never
	  'offline' or 'unknown', and the node isn't fping'ed anymore.

	Bugfixes:
	- Adjusted (S)VCD bitrate overhead calculation (mpeg2enc's -B
	  parameter) to audio + 2% of overall stream (was 1%), because
	  1% seems to be underestimated in general.
	- (S)VCD disc size calculation didn't consider the per disc
	  overhead of 600 sectors. Again thanks to Julio Sánchez.
	- Vorbis sample rate conversion didn't work.
	- transcoding to OGG without audio didn't work. Thanks for the
	  report to Clint Silvester <clint AT focuscompanies.com>
	- Volume scanning of PCM audio tracks didn't work.
	- Cluster mode: additional audio tracks with OGG didn't work.

0.49.1 [unstable branch] Fri 27 Dec 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- File format changed and isn't backward compatible. Old project
	  files are autoconverted, but older dvd::rip versions can't open
	  files saved with this version.

	Bugfixes:
	- All changes from 0.48.0 - 0.48.6 are included in this release
	  (refer to the corresponding Changes entries for details)
	- Cluster mode: fixed missing progress information for merge
	  jobs. Thanks for the fix to Fabio Russo.

	Features:
	- Applied a patch from Stefan Gmeiner <riddlebox AT freesurf.ch>,
	  which adds the ability of estimating the image size before
	  burning on the fly, which is needed for some drives (e.g.
	  TEAC).
	- Partially applied a patch from Petros Stavrakakis
	  <petros AT stavrakakis.de> which brings more detailed options
	  for cdrdao, in particular you can select the cdrdao-driver
	  and buffersize.
	- On the transcode tab a new setting "Container format" was added,
	  currently with three options: AVI, OGG, (S)VCD. This way you
	  explicitely decide a container format first, the GUI follows
	  this decision and enables/disables all other options accordingly.
	  If actual settings can't be done with a selected container
	  these will be set to reasonably defaults, with correspondent
	  messages in the log.
	- mp3/ac3 audio codecs now supported also for OGG container. You
	  need at least ogmtools v0.960 (I tested with v0.970).
	- Preliminary support for vorbis quality based encoding. Future
	  versions will determine real audio size after encoding the
	  1st pass (when using 2pass transcoding) and will adjust
	  video bitrate accordingly for the 2nd pass.
	- Option to change the audio samplerate (be careful with odd
	  values here, transcode resp. lame bails out for ununsal
	  samplerates - 48000, 44100 and 24000 always worked for me).
	  Requested long time ago by Certron DiSoni.
	- A new window "Bitrate calculation details" shows all steps of
	  the video bitrate calculation, so you can see exactly what
	  happens here. The window can stay open all the time. Its
	  calculation sheet follows your settings immediately.
	- Bitrate calculation now considers selected chapters correctly.
	- A new checkbox "manual video bitrate" let you decide explicetly,
	  if you want dvd::rip to calculate the video bitrate for you,
	  or not. By default, it's disabled and the video bitrate entry
	  not sensible. If you enable the "manual" checkbox, dvd::rip
	  doesn't touch your setting, even if you change the target size,
	  disc count popup etc.
	- Adjusted CD size presets to standard values: 650,703,800,870
	  (which are 74, 80, 90, 99 minute CD-R with 2048 bytes sector
	  size. 2324 byte sector size for VCD is now considered, see
	  below). Thanks to Julio Sánchez <j.sanchezf AT terra.es>.
	- (S)VCD sector sizes are considered for SVCD video bitrate
	  calculation, so you can select a CD size from the popup and
	  need not to fiddle with SVCD space on your own. This maybe
	  somewhat confusing on the one hand (because the resulting size is
	  magically bigger than your setting), but on the other hand
	  the CD-ROM disc sizes are well-known. And you still can enter
	  arbitrary MB values by hand, so I decided to leave the MB based
	  size definition (beside a CD-R duration / minute based one).
	  Thanks to Julio Sánchez who enlighted several details of the
	  (S)VCD specification, which were new to me.
	- Some further SVCD improvements, e.g. min-gop-size and max-gop-size
	  values depending on PAL/NTSC are set. Thanks a lot for the
	  (S)VCD help to Tom Vijlbrief <tom.vijlbrief AT ision.nl>
	- AVI/OGG/MPEG container overhead is now considered for video
	  bitrate calculation. Thanks to Markus Liebl for some tests
	  and hints regarding measuring the overhead values, and Moritz
	  Bunkus for information about OGG overhead.
	- Dropped the "YUV internally" setting from the GUI, it's always
	  enabled.

0.48.8 [stable branch] Mon 06 Jan 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Clip & Zoom: width and height of zoom/clip2 stages didn't
	  update correctly if no zoom was set. Thanks for the report
	  to Joakim Verona <joakim AT verona.se>.

0.48.7 [stable branch] Mon 06 Jan 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- CD size wasn't set in (S)VCD transcode command. Reported
	  by Markus Dewerny <dewerny AT web.de> and Dirk Aust
	  <dirk_aust AT gmx.de>.

0.48.6 [stable branch] Fri 13 Dec 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a typo in the vcdimager command (which didn't affect
	  proper operation on my system, but it was anyway a typo ;)
	  Thanks for report and fix to Tom Vijlbrief <tom.vijlbrief
	  AT ision.nl>
	- Using "Create vobsub now" threw an exception due to a missing
	  avi directory. Thanks to Eckehardt Luhm <bselu AT web.de>.

0.48.5 [stable branch] Sat 7 Dec 2002, joern
	Bugfix:
	- 0.48.3 introduced a bug which prevents multiple audio
	  tracks with OGG/Vorbis. Thanks to Lethal Weapon for
	  the report.

0.48.4 [stable branch] Wed 4 Dec 2002, joern
	Bugfix:
	- Fixed a dumb bug, where dvd::rip complained about a missing
	  avi directory when transcoding a title the first time.
	  Thanks for the report to Florin Andrei (I'm wondering why
	  nobody found this bug earlier - it should exist since version
	  0.47.5 - anyway, now it's fixed ;)

0.48.3 [stable branch] Tue 3 Dec 2002, joern
	Features:
	- dvd::rip now checks on startup if you're using Perl 5.8
	  without having PERLIO=stdio set. If yes, dvd::rip sets
	  the variable for you and restarts. (This bug is already
	  reported to the Perl developers and hopefully fixed
	  soon, so dvd::rip can drop this workaround somedays).

	Bugfixes:
	- Adding additional audio tracks didn't work for DVD image
	  and on-the-fly transcoding. Reported by Matthias Hennemann
	  <Matthias.Hennemann AT Organik.Uni-Erlangen.DE>
	- Free diskspace wasn't printed before ripping. Reported
	  by Florin Andrei.
	- Fixed a possible bug regarding proper ac3 audio codec
	  detection which probably depends on the used libdvdread
	  version. Thanks to Ronny Buchmann <ronny-transcode AT
	  vlugnet.org> who reported a bug in dvd::rip's automatic file
	  conversion, which is most likely a consequence of an
	  failed ac3 detection.

0.48.2 [stable branch] Sun 24 Nov 2002, joern
	Bugfix:
	- transcode 0.6.2 changed its progress output for transcoding
	  frames ranges. dvd::rip didn't show a valid progress bar
	  due to that. Thanks for the report to Florin Andrei.

0.48.1 [stable branch] Sat 23 Nov 2002, joern
	Note:
	- transcode 0.6.2 was released on 22. November. dvd::rip
	  works with all 0.6 releases, but 0.6.2 is recommended.
	  dvd::rip disables some features for smaller versions.
	
	Features:
	- Added 64 kbit/s audio bitrate preset entry. Suggested by
	  Miguel J. Jimenez <cactus_espinado AT yahoo.es>
	- ffmpeg video codec setting adjusted to the new ffmpeg
	  interface of transcode 0.6.2. Thanks for the hint to
	  Stefano <stefano AT symbola.it>
	- subtitleripper version is now checked, a correspondent
	  note is printed, if a version smaller than 0.3 is detected.
	  Arne Driescher build a transcode independent tarball
	  of this release, which you can get from Sourceforge:
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleripper

	Bugfixes:
	- Burning tab: label information followed file selection only
	  on the GUI, but old values were used internally.
	- IFO file copying didn't work for DVD image projects. Thanks
	  for the report to Arne Driescher.
	- thranduil <thranduil AT free.fr> reported that dvd::rip's
	  vcdimager command works only with long options. I can't
	  reproduce this, but I switched over to the long options,
	  just to be sure.

0.48.0 [stable branch] Sun 17 Nov 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- transcode 0.6.2.20021114 is the recommended version for
	  this release. 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 still work, but dvd::rip
	  lacks features with them, e.g. subtitle support.
	- From 0.47.6 on dvd::rip needs to know the mount point of your
	  DVD device. So open the preferences dialog and enter your
	  mount point there. Also the DVD must be mountable by the
	  user who executes dvd::rip.
	- File format changed slightly with 0.47.2, but is backward
	  compatible. dvd::rip prints a short message when converting
	  an older file to the new format.
	- Version numbering changes with this release. It follows
	  the common MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme. Two branches are
	  distuingished using the MINOR number: the stable branch
	  uses even numbers, the unstable odd. So the next stable
	  release is 0.50.0, bugfixes on 0.48.0 will be numbered 
	  0.48.1, 0.48.2 etc and the next unstable branch is 0.49.1,
	  0.49.2 etc.
	- Read all change log entries of 0.47 to see what changed
	  in detail since 0.46.

	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a "division by zero" bug on Clip & Zoom tab.
	- Subtitles: test transcoding threw an exception, if no
	  preview images were grabbed. Reported by Andreas Lemke.

0.47.12 Wed 13 Nov 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Changing mp2 bitrate threw an exception. Thanks for the report
	  to Andreas Lemke <andreas.lemke AT epost.de>
	- Transcoding failed, if no subtitles were detected. Also
	  reported by Andreas Lemke.
	- Message about wrong transcode version on the subtitle tab
	  was too big, the project window needed to grow for it.

0.47.11 Tue 12 Nov 2002, joern
	Note:
	- Actual transcode pre-0.6.2 snapshots have a bug in cluster
	  mode, which destroys A/V sync, while transcode 0.6.1 works
	  fine. The next transcode snapshot should fix that issue.
	  Until that happens I suggest using 0.6.1 for cluster
	  operation.
      
	Features:
	- Reorganized the video options widgets on the transcode tab
	  a bit. Makes more sense now, in my opinion.
	- Menu entry "Operate/Create dvdrip-info file" (dvdrip-info
	  file is by default created when you start transcoding).
	- Information about subtitles added to the dvdrip-info file.

	Bugfixes:
	- The subtitle grabbing frame/timecode entry rejected
	  timecode values.
	- Autoadjust presets failed, when the movie had unusual
	  frame sizes (mostly this happened, if the preview frame
	  was a bad choice, e.g. it's mostly black. Then letterbox
	  detection didn't work properly and dvd::rip's autoadjust
	  mechanism bailed out).
	- Subtitle sort order in selection popup was alphanumeric.
	- Subtitle preview grabbing still didn't work if the
	  selection popup wasn't touched after ripping.
	- Pressing the "Scan volume" button did nothing if the
	  title wasn't ripped, instead of telling the user, *that*
	  the title isn't ripped ;) Thanks for the report to
	  Chris Jensen <chris AT drspirograph.com>.
	- Cluster mode:
	  - Nodes stopped by hand, didn't get online anymore
	    after starting them again.
	  - Nodes' "stopped" state wasn't restored properly in
	    case of a dvdrip-master restart.

0.47.10 Wed 06 Nov 2002, joern
	Features:
	- DVD mounting only for copying the IFO files, not for TOC
	  reading and ripping. Because the mount may make problems
	  (if your system isn't configured properly), this reduces
	  the harm a bit, because only the IFO files will be missing.
	  This affects vobsub subtitle generation only, everything
	  else will work as usual.

	Bugfixes:
	- IFO file copying didn't work, if the DVD wasn't mounted
	  already.
	- Fractional volume rescale values were rejected. Thanks for
	  the report to Laurent Grawet.

0.47.9 Fri 01 Nov 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Spaces in the frame range entries produced illegal transcode
	  options. Reported by Andrea Carpani <ancarpan AT tiscalinet.it>.
	- All entry fields are now syntax checked (e.g. non-digits
	  are rejected when a number is expected).
	- When ripping multiple titles or chapters, dvd::rip calculated
	  6 GB x (number of titles/chapters) as the assumed disk space,
	  instead of assuming 6 GB once. Reported by Michel Alexandre
	  Salim.
	- Cancelling a rip after a disk usage warning didn't set
	  the ripping GUI sensitive again.
	- Cluster mode: switch node state from offline to online after
	  a 20 second delay (a booting machine answeres ping requests
	  some time before the ssh daemon is up - this way the system
	  has 20 seconds to start the ssh daemon after starting the
	  network; this should suffice). Requested by Matthias Kukuk
	  <m.kukuk AT gmx.de>
	- AC3 audio tab was always active, even if the selected audio
	  channel was no AC3.
	- Ripping didn't work, when the DVD wasn't mounted by the user
	  before.

0.47.8 Wed 30 Oct 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a typo which breaks subtitle transcoding. Thanks to
	  Paul Gohn <pgohn AT nexgo.de> for the report and
	  William Hawkins <whawkins AT vt.edu> for the fix.

0.47.7 Tue 29 Oct 2002, joern
	Features:
	- Added another RPM spec file RedHat-Rawhide-Video-DVDRip.spec.
	  Sorry for my ignorance, but I don't understand anything of
	  RPM spec files and don't why or whether they are really distro
	  specific or not. I just add them, if I get them. This one
	  was sent by Ragnar Kjørstad <dvdrip AT ragnark.vestdata.no>.
	  Thanks.

	Bugfixes:
	- The "dvd mount point" check in the preferences dialog didn't
	  work reliably with all distributions, so I dropped it (resp.
	  the existence of the mount point is checked only). Thanks
	  to Douglas Bollinger for the report.
	- dvd::rip now checks the mount state of the DVD reliably
	  and really mounts the DVD only, if it isn't mounted yet
	  (considering automounters, which were problematic). Thanks
	  to Davide Ferrari for the bug report.

0.47.6 Mon 28 Oct 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- From now on dvd::rip needs to know the mount point of your
	  DVD device. So open the preferences dialog and enter your
	  mount point there. Also the DVD must be mountable by the
	  user who executes dvd::rip.
	- To get vobsub support you must re-read the TOC from your DVD.
	  (which nukes your settings of the project - sorry, but it's
	   a beta release).

	Features:
	- Subtitles: dvd::rip now creates vobsub files, which can be
	  played with mplayer, using Arne Driescher's subtitle2vobsub.
	  Splitting is considered, you get one vobsub per splitted file.
	  You can create the vobsub by pressing the appropriate button
	  on the Subtitle tab, or by checking "Create later after
	  transcoding". Chapter mode isn't supported. Cluster mode support
	  will follow (you can start vobsub creation from dvd::rip's
	  Operate menu after transcoding with the cluster). A .rar file is
	  created, if rar is present on your system. You need a recent
	  mplayer (I use 0.90pre9) to play rar-vobsub files. Attention:
	  your rar binary *must not* be newer than 2.x (3.x isn't
	  supported by mplayer; I use rar 2.71 with success here).
	  It's hard to find such an old version, so you can grab it
	  from here: http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin
	  Thanks to Arne for the hint about rar-vobsub and again for
	  his great subtitleripper package. You can play a vobsub with
	  these mplayer options:

	  mplayer -vobsub movie-001-sid02 movie-001.avi

	  (In this example the vosub file(s) are "movie-001-sid02.rar"
	   resp. "movie-001-sid02.{ifo,sub,idx}")

	- IFO files: dvd::rip copies the .ifo files into the project's
	  tmp/ifo directory when reading the TOC.
	- Disc size popup became a combo box, so you can enter arbitrary
	  disc sizes (for customized splitting, e.g. if you want to
	  leave space for other stuff, you want to put on the CD's).
	- dvd::rip prints a warning message if you use RH 8.0 without
	  the PERLIO=stdio environment variable set. Requested by
	  Michael Mason <mgm AT eskimoman.net>. NEEDS TESTING, please
	  report to dvdrip-user, whether this works!

	Bugfixes:
	- transcode supports rendering subtitles only with -x vob, that
	  means I had to switch off rendering support for on-the-fly
	  and dvd-image-ripping. Creating vobsub's work for all modes.
	- Subtitle grabbing didn't work for titles which have only one
	  subtitle, or if you never explicetely selected a subtitle from
	  the popup. You must re-read the TOC for the fix to take effect.
	  Thanks to Michèl Alexandre Salim for the extensive bug report.
	- When ripping on-thy-fly or from an DVD image, the "Rip" button
	  is disabled instead of alter it to a "Volume scan" button.
	  Volume scanning can be done on the Transcode tab, so this function
	  is rather confusing on the Rip tab.
	- When zoom width/height were empty, dvd::rip produced illegal
	  fast resizing transcode options.
	- CD burning: list of files was refreshed when entering the
	  transcode tab instead of the burn tab.
	- dvd::rip crashed on first startup, when no ~/.dvdriprc file
	  was present. Thanks to Davide Ferarri for the detailed report.

0.47.5 Wed 16 Oct 2002, joern
	Features:
	- Extensive support for rendering subtitles on the movie
	  (creating vobsub files is prepared, not yet implemented
	  but coming soon). Subtitle stuff is on its own tab, documentation
	  will follow. You need at least transcode 0.6.2.20021010 for this
	  to work. For existent projects you must re-read the DVD TOC,
	  because subtitle-detection is done here. Also you need a recent
	  CVS version of subtitle2pgm from Arne Driescher's subtitleripper
	  package. You can find it on his project homepage:
	  
	  http://subtitleripper.sourceforge.net/
	  
	  If you're unfamilar with CVS: I put a snapshot together of the
	  version I'm currently using. You can find it here:

	  http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/subtitleripper-20021015.tgz

	  Thanks a lot to Arne, who added some features on my request
	  to make it work seamlessly with dvd::rip.
          dvd::rip's subtitle support isn't finished yet, a few things
	  could be improved, e.g. the suggestion functions should be
	  capable of addding black bars in the clip1 stage or addding black
	  bars in clip2 for 4:3 movies etc. Stay tuned.
	- When transcoding a .dvdrip-info file is generated, which
	  contains some interesting technical information about the
	  created movie file. Thanks to Moritz Bunkus for this
	  suggestion.
	- Use a notebook for the different audio codecs supported by
	  dvd::rip, instead of struggling around with making widgets
	  sensitive when possible. This makes things much clearer and
	  is more flexible, because audio options can differ much more,
	  depending on the selected codec. Also pages of codecs, which
	  aren't supported with the current settings, are hided instead
	  of making them unsensitive.
	- DVD audio popup now shows "=> skip" for audio tracks, which
	  are not selected for transcoding. I had some reports of users
	  regarding wrong transcoded audio channels, but in fact they
	  missed activating the desired audio track correctly. I hope
	  such misunderstandings don't happen anymore now.
	- Status bar shows free disk space, when idle.
	- Free disk space is checked before starting a job which
	  needs some. dvd::rip currently doesn't know in advance
	  how much space a ripped title will need. As a thumb rule
	  dvd::rip warns if less than 6GB are available. Space
	  checking applies to standard mode only, not cluster mode.
	- After an intensive mailing list discussion about the correct
	  file extension for OGG files containing video tracks
	  (.ogg vs .ogm), I yielded to Roland Seuhs arguments and
	  decided that .ogm is now the default file extension for OGG
	  files. You can change this in the preference dialog, if you
	  prefer .ogg (or an arbitrary different file extension...)
	- CD burning / cdrdao command: if the configured cdrdao command
	  contains the 'write' option already, dvd::rip doesn't add
	  it again. This way you can provide specific cdrdao options.
	  (cdrdao expects 'write' as the first parameter). Thanks
	  to Christian Herrmann <paras.rasmatazz AT t-online.de> for
	  the hint 
	- Added a rpmspecs/ folder in the distribution, which currently
	  contains RPM spec files for SuSE 8.0 and RedHat 8.0. I doesn't
	  maintain all of these files personally, e.g. version numbers
	  may be outdated or something like that. But I hope they are
	  useful anyway. Thanks to Michèl Alexandre Salim <salimma1
	  AT yahoo.co.uk>, who provided the RedHat and to Rainer Lay
	  Lay for the SuSE file.

	Bugfixes:
	- Clip&Zoom video preview command did not appear in the
	  logfile. Thanks to Michael Bushey for the report.
	- Not enough: Clip&Zoom video preview didn't even work from
	  ripped VOB's. Same report by Michael Bushey.
	- Add. transcode options weren't passed through when
	  transcoding audio for multiple audio tracks (e.g. -D to
	  correct A/V sync mismatch). Thanks to Clint Silvester
	  <clint AT focuscompanies.com> for his report.
	- Clipping didn't work if clip entries were empty (which
	  should be interpreted as 0 instead). Reported by Michael
	  Bushey.
	- Audio size calculation on transcode tab wasn't correct
	  (calculated base 1024 instead 1000), but the correct value
	  was used for video bitrate calculation.
	- When changing from mp3 to vorbis dvd::rip automatically
	  choose vorbis for additional tracks on the GUI, but this
	  wasn't stored internally, so generated transcode commands
	  still had mp3 options. Reported by edaniel <edaniel AT
	  perso.mine.nu>.
	- Titles with no target audio track threw an exception in
	  cluster mode. As long as the cluster doesn't support this,
	  dvd::rip prevents adding such a title to a cluster. Reported
	  by Rainer Lay.

0.47.4 Sun 6 Oct 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- On the fly CD burning didn't work (fortunately without
	  destroying the CD...).
	- Updated RPM spec file which now considers pstree for
	  standard mode.
	
0.47.3 Sun 6 Oct 2002, joern
	Notes:
	- dvd::rip now generally depends on 'pstree' not only in
	  cluster mode
	- Red Hat 8.0's Perl distribution has a bug regarding
	  pipes using non-blocking I/O. dvd::rip doesn *not* work
	  with RH 8.0 due to this. Refer to the news entry 2002/10/06
	  on http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/ for details.

	Features:
	- Simple CD burning facility. Supports ISO, VCD2 and SVCD
	  types. Needs mkisofs, cdrecord for ISO operation and
	  vcdimager, cdrdao for (S)VCD operation.
	  All commands can and must be configured in the global
	  preferences. cdrecord and cdrdao must be able to operate
	  as a normal user resp. the user who executes dvd::rip.
	  cdrecord must either be set-uid-root or executed through
	  xcdrwrap from an existent xcdroast installation. cdrdao
	  must be set-uid-root or the CD burner device file must
	  be writable by the user who executes dvd::rip.
	  Warning: currently *no* special checking beside existence
	  of the needed tools is done, so use this on your own risk.
	  Try burning in "test mode" first. I tested this with
	  * cdrecord 1.11a31
	  * cdrdao 1.1.5
	  * mkisofs 1.15a29
	  * vcdimager 0.7.12
	  and don't know if other versions work, too.
	- Debugging window shows CD burning commands for the selected
	  file entries.
	- Global preferences now splitted into several pages of
	  a notebook widget. Added a simple checking of the specified
	  values, e.g. if the DVD device and default project directory
	  are writable, or if specified tools exist.
	- New preference: ogg file extension. Suggested by Moritz Bunkus.
	  dvd::rip defauls to '.ogg', but you can switch to '.ogm' or
	  arbitrary extensions, if this makes using the files more
	  comfortable for you.
	- Added a rpm spec file Video-DVDRip.spec, so you can simply
	  build a .rpm archive from the .tar.gz using 
	  > rpm -ta Video-DVDRip-0.XX.tar.gz
	  Thanks to Rainer Ley for the spec file template.
	- Button "Nuke log file" on logging tab, which resets the
	  log file.
	- dvd::rip now opens the preferences dialog, if no ~/.dvdriprc
	  is found resp. on first startup.

	Bugfixes:
	- PSU core setting was ignored when adding add. audio-tracks,
	  reported by Lethal Weapon <lethalwp AT tiscali.be>
	- Window title was not cleared, if a project was closed,
 	  reported by Fabio Russo

0.47.2 Mon 30 Sep 2002, joern
	Note:
	- File format changed slightly, but is backward compatible.
	  dvd::rip prints a short message when converting an older
	  file to the new format.

	Features:
	- Experimental OGG/Vorbis audio support. If you choose
	  Vorbis as an audio codec, the result will be a .ogm
	  file with DivX/Xvid/whatever video and Vorbis audio
	  (so this implicetely switches the resulting file container
	  format from AVI to OGG - which will become an explicite
	  option, once OGG support is more complete).

	  Splitting is supported. Cluster mode support available only
	  for movies with one PSU. Movies with more than one PSU will be
	  supported when ogmtools provide a program for concatenating
	  OGG streams. Multiple audio tracks are supported, but you
	  currently can't mix mp3/ac3/vorbis codecs for the same title.
	  (mp3/ac3 is supported by ogmtools, but without A/V sync).
	  You need ogmtools 0.950 and transcode 0.6.1 for the whole
	  thing to work. You can get ogmtools here:
	  
	  http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/index.html
	  
	  Thanks to Moritz Bunkus for writing ogmtools and answering
	  my questions.

	- when opening a project file, dvd::rip now selects
	  automatically the tab which was selected when the file
	  was saved.
	- new dvdrip command line options "-f {transcode|transcode_split}"
	  and "-t title-nr" to select a title of a given project file
	  on startup and transcode (and optionally split) it.
	  dvd::rip exits after finishing, so this can be used for
	  simple batch transcoding a bunch of projects/titles, if
	  cluster mode is no option for you (e.g. in case of NTSC movies).
	  Thanks to Rainer Lay for his suggestion.

	  Example: dvdrip -t 1 -f transcode_split movie.rip

	Bugfixes:
	- Cluster mode: if a frame range was set, dvdrip-master
	  crashed with a fatal error (transcoding a frame range
	  is still not supported with cluster mode, but really no
	  need for dvdrip-master to crash here... ;)

0.47.1 Sun 29 Sep 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Progress information was messed up when transcoding
	  chapters from a DVD image or when doing direct DVD
	  transcoding. Because dvd::rip can't know the chapter
	  length in advance in this case, now no progress information
	  is printed (no percent/eta), only fps and elapsed time.
	  Thanks to David Rosky <d_rosky AT nccn.net> for his
	  detailed bug report.
	- Chapter mode: ripping progress is related to the length
	  of the title, what is confusing if not all chapters are
	  selected. For single chapter ripping now no percent/eta
	  progress is printed anymore. Reported by David Rosky.
	- Cluster mode: node test didn't work (stalled). Thanks for
	  the report to Fabio Russo <f.russo AT anthesia.it>.
