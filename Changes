Revision history for Perl extension Video::DVDRip

0.26 Sun Dec 16 2001, joern
	Bugfix:
	- tar.gz distribution was incomplete. Updated MANIFEST.

0.25 Sat Dec 15 2001, joern
	Features:
	- create logfile of all processes, display it in a separate
	  logging tab
	- renamed "Snapshot Directory" to "Temp Directory", because
	  it's used not only for the snapshot images. DivX4 analyze logs
	  and the dvd::rip log are also stored here.

	Bugfixes:
	- "transcode & split" did not work
	- spaces in project name not allowed, thanks to
	  Matthias Rieber <matthias AT lsoe.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	  for the bug report. dvd::rip did not work correctly
	  with spaces in the project name. Checking of other
	  user supplied values is still on my TODO list.

0.24 Thu Dec 13 2001, joern
	Just a major release, no changes since pre-release.

0.24_02  Tue Dec 11 2001, joern
	Features:
	- You can open a debugging window, which shows all transcode
	  commands executed by dvd::rip by pressing Ctrl+T or selecting the
	  "Debug/Show Transcode Commands..." menu item. Thanks to
	  Norbert Preining for his suggestion. This should help finding
	  bugs in dvd::rip, where wrong transcode options are genereated,
	  or something similar.
	- modified 16:9 anamorph fast resizing Preset: added 2nd Clipping
	  to get rid of 4 black top and bottom lines
	- Added a transcode title number field to the rip tab. This way
	  you can workaround the transcode/libdvdread bug which results
	  to wrong assigned titles. Please use this with care and only
	  if you know, what you do. This fields changes only the title
	  number passed to all transcode commands. The dvd::rip filenames
	  will be named with the orignally (maybe wrong) scanned title nr.
	  Thanks to Bjoern Buerger <b.buerger AT tu-bs.de> for his
	  suggestion.

	Bugfixes:
	- Preset "16:9 Anam. Enc., No Letterbox, Fast Resize" did not
	  switch fast resizing on
	- Fast Resizing: 32 pixel boundary must be given only for
	  axes which are resized. Thanks to Norbert Preining for
	  his patch.
	- dvd::rip now checks, whether VOB files are already ripped,
	  even if the project file says, they're not (e.g. if you
	  forget to save after ripping, restart dvd::rip and create
	  a new project for this DVD). Thanks to Norbert Preining
	  for the hint.
	- dvd::rip now checks if the needed programs (transcode,
	  ImageMagick etc.) are installed and complains if not.
	  Thanks to Michal Szymanski <msz AT astrouw.edu.pl> for his
	  bugreport.

0.23  Sun Dec 09 2001, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- fast resizing: 32 pixel boundary check ommited checking the
	  clip1 size
	- transcode progress label did always show the "split afterwards"
	  message, even if started without splitting.

0.22  Sun Dec 09 2001, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- applied Perl 5.005 patch supplied by Norbert
	  Preining <preining AT logic.at>. Thanks.
	- DVD read-toc code always tried a mount, even if the
	  DVD was already mounted. This could confuse systems
	  using automounter.

	New Features:
	- Support of the fast resizing algorithm of transcode
	  (transcode-0.5.2-20011206 is recommended because of
	  a bug in the horizontal fast resize code in earlier
	  versions). Fast resizing presumes 32 pixel boundaries.
	  If you break with this rule, you'll get an error window
	  on transcoding. I'm planning a wizard which helps
	  calculating the correct values, because this can be a
	  brain squeezing task ;)
	- Added two new Presets for anamorph transcoding using the
	  fast resizing algorithm. They should bypass the time,
	  until the fast resizing wizard is finished.
	- Support of multipass DivX encoding.
	- Added a button to the Transcode tab for viewing the
	  transcoded non-splitted AVI file.
	- transcode progress label shows, whether started with or
	  without splitting

0.21  Sat Dec 01 2001, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- fixed color problem with snapshot images
	
	New Features:
	- transcode 0.5.1 supports 4GB AVI files, so max.
	  filesize for the bitrate suggestion is now 4000 MB
	  (was 2000 MB with transcode 0.5.0)

0.20  Tue Nov 27 2001, joern
	- First public release. Should be usable but is not tested
	  with thousands of DVDs.
