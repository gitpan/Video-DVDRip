Revision history for Perl extension Video::DVDRip

0.30 Sat Jan 19 2002, joern
	Features:
	- Christian Lambert sent me an enhanced version of my
	  fast resize calculator kspread file.

	Bugfixes:
	- creating a new project failed with an exception,
	  thanks to Christian Lambert for his bug report.
	- splitpipe did not work correctly if you use transcode
	  0.5.x, thanks to Marc Wäckerlin <mrw AT atheismus.ch>
	  for his bug report.
	- opening the "Show transcode commands" window without
	  an opened project threw an exception.

0.30_01 Sat Jan 12 2002, joern
	Quick pre-release, because I like this feature so much ;)

	Features:
	- added fast frame grabbing using the vob navigation
	  information created by 'tcdemux -W' for transcode
	  >= 0.6.0pre. Frame grabbing now needs a constant
	  amount of time (2-3 seconds on my A1000 workstation),
	  regardless of the frame number, you entered.
	  transcode 0.5.x is still supported, using the -c
	  option, which is slow because it decodes all precedent
	  frames. Thanks to Thomas Östreich, who helped me
	  demystifying the navigation logfile ;)

0.29 Thu Jan 10 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- ripping progress bar enabled for transcode >= 0.6.0
	  (you *must* use at least transcode-0.6.0pre2-20020107.
	  Older 0.6.0 pre-releases will cause dvd::rip to fail
	  badly or just freezing it). dvd::rip uses the new -W
	  switch of tcdemux to get the progress in the ripping 
	  stage. This gives even enough information to calculate
	  fps. Coooool... ;)
	- You can use dvd::rip with transcode 0.5.x (x>=3),
	  but the ripping progress bar will be disabled.

	Features:
	- transcode version is detected on startup, so different
	  behaviour for different transcode versions is possible.
	- preparing for cluster mode: dvd::rip already creates
	  the neccessary vob navigation logging data.

0.29_01 Sun Jan 07 2002, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- DVD TOC reading completely reorganized. Should work now
	  more reliable with all DVDs. Due to this there is currently
	  no progress bar for ripping available.
	- DVD TOC missed scrollbars
	- transcode progress bar did not work with transcode 0.6pre

0.28 Fri Jan 04 2002, joern
	Features:
	- I added a contrib directory to the distribution, currently
	  containing a KSpread file which helps calculating fast resize
	  values. I'm planning to integrate a native and quite more usable
	  version of this sheet into dvd::rip, but maybe this helps someone
	  while this feature is not finished. On the other hand the
	  presets are working well for most DVDs, so this is currently
	  a nice to have feature for me.

	Bugfixes:
	- avisplit progress bar missed percentage and ETA.
	- fast resize option did not always complain about illegal
	  values, thanks to Christian Lambert <clambert AT csd.sgi.com>
	  for the bug report.

0.28_03 Thu Jan 03 2002, joern
	Features:
	- Full viewing angle support, requested by Certron DiSoni
	  <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>. You can select the viewing
	  channel after reading the TOC. Only the selected angle
	  will be ripped from the DVD. This way I was able to rip
	  german Star Wars Episode I, with the german intro.

	Bugfixes:
	- transcode progress bar missed percentage and ETA.

0.28_02 Thu Jan 03 2002, joern
	Again a pre-release due to major changes in the progress module
	and chapter mode code. Please test it. Thanks.

	Features:
	- enhanced chapter mode suggested by Tim Currie <jtcurrie AT
	  mediaone.net>: dvd::rip now shows a multi selection list
	  of avaiable chapters per title. Now you can decide which
	  chapters should be ripped and transcoded. Currently no progress
	  bar is shown in the chapter selection mode, only the elapsed
	  time will be printed. Also avisplit is currently not available
	  in chapter mode. I'm not shure, if transcode reports the correct
	  number of chapters. Often the higher chapters are empty or
	  at least *very* short.
	- major code cleanup in the progress bar module. Among other things
	  a Gtk input handler is used instead of a Gtk idle function.
	  This way the GUI responses much better. Also all calculations
	  (elapsed time, ETA, fps) are done by dvd::rip now and available
	  for all tasks.

	Bugfixes:
	- fixed chapter mode transcoding progress bar / logging problem
	- dvd::rip failed if the project path was not absolute. Thanks to
	  George Farris <george AT gmsys.com> for the report.

0.28_01 Fri Dec 28 2001, joern
	This is a pre release for testing the new Chapter Mode feature.
	Please use this version only, if you're interested in this feature
	or if you want to test it in general. Also non-Chapter-Mode ripping
	may be affected or buggy.

	Features:
	- Chapter Mode, suggested by Norbert Preining.
	  You have to enable this on the RIP Title Tab before ripping,
	  because each chapter will be ripped into a separate directory.
	  Transcoding in chapter mode will lead to one AVI file for
	  each chapter. The progress bar guesses sometimes wrong, but the
	  result should be Ok. Splitting in Chapter Mode is not supported
	  and makes no sense in general.
	- removed the tcprobe-random-title-permutation workaround,
	  because this tcprobe bug is fixed in transcode 0.5.3

	Bugfixes:
	- dvd::rip didn't work with transcode 0.5.3 due to changes
	  of tcprobe output. Thanks to Thomas Speck <thomas-speck
	  AT gmx.de> for his bug report. This release has a workaround
	  fixing this problem. Another solution is to patch transcode
	  0.5.3 with a patch published by Thomas Östreich on his
	  transcode homepage.

0.27 Tue Dec 18 2001, joern
	Bugfix:
	- this release fixes only a minor bug in the debugging window
	  and log file output. The snapshot command missed the
	  frame number, so the -c option was malformed.

0.26 Sun Dec 16 2001, joern
	Bugfix:
	- tar.gz distribution was incomplete. Updated MANIFEST.

0.25 Sat Dec 15 2001, joern
	Features:
	- create logfile of all processes, display it in a separate
	  logging tab
	- renamed "Snapshot Directory" to "Temp Directory", because
	  it's used not only for the snapshot images. DivX4 analyze logs
	  and the dvd::rip log are also stored here.

	Bugfixes:
	- "transcode & split" did not work
	- spaces in project name not allowed, thanks to
	  Matthias Rieber <matthias AT lsoe.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	  for the bug report. dvd::rip did not work correctly
	  with spaces in the project name. Checking of other
	  user supplied values is still on my TODO list.

0.24 Thu Dec 13 2001, joern
	Just a major release, no changes since pre-release.

0.24_02  Tue Dec 11 2001, joern
	Features:
	- You can open a debugging window, which shows all transcode
	  commands executed by dvd::rip by pressing Ctrl+T or selecting the
	  "Debug/Show Transcode Commands..." menu item. Thanks to
	  Norbert Preining for his suggestion. This should help finding
	  bugs in dvd::rip, where wrong transcode options are genereated,
	  or something similar.
	- modified 16:9 anamorph fast resizing Preset: added 2nd Clipping
	  to get rid of 4 black top and bottom lines
	- Added a transcode title number field to the rip tab. This way
	  you can workaround the transcode/libdvdread bug which results
	  to wrong assigned titles. Please use this with care and only
	  if you know, what you do. This fields changes only the title
	  number passed to all transcode commands. The dvd::rip filenames
	  will be named with the orignally (maybe wrong) scanned title nr.
	  Thanks to Bjoern Buerger <b.buerger AT tu-bs.de> for his
	  suggestion.

	Bugfixes:
	- Preset "16:9 Anam. Enc., No Letterbox, Fast Resize" did not
	  switch fast resizing on
	- Fast Resizing: 32 pixel boundary must be given only for
	  axes which are resized. Thanks to Norbert Preining for
	  his patch.
	- dvd::rip now checks, whether VOB files are already ripped,
	  even if the project file says, they're not (e.g. if you
	  forget to save after ripping, restart dvd::rip and create
	  a new project for this DVD). Thanks to Norbert Preining
	  for the hint.
	- dvd::rip now checks if the needed programs (transcode,
	  ImageMagick etc.) are installed and complains if not.
	  Thanks to Michal Szymanski <msz AT astrouw.edu.pl> for his
	  bugreport.

0.23  Sun Dec 09 2001, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- fast resizing: 32 pixel boundary check ommited checking the
	  clip1 size
	- transcode progress label did always show the "split afterwards"
	  message, even if started without splitting.

0.22  Sun Dec 09 2001, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- applied Perl 5.005 patch supplied by Norbert
	  Preining <preining AT logic.at>. Thanks.
	- DVD read-toc code always tried a mount, even if the
	  DVD was already mounted. This could confuse systems
	  using automounter.

	New Features:
	- Support of the fast resizing algorithm of transcode
	  (transcode-0.5.2-20011206 is recommended because of
	  a bug in the horizontal fast resize code in earlier
	  versions). Fast resizing presumes 32 pixel boundaries.
	  If you break with this rule, you'll get an error window
	  on transcoding. I'm planning a wizard which helps
	  calculating the correct values, because this can be a
	  brain squeezing task ;)
	- Added two new Presets for anamorph transcoding using the
	  fast resizing algorithm. They should bypass the time,
	  until the fast resizing wizard is finished.
	- Support of multipass DivX encoding.
	- Added a button to the Transcode tab for viewing the
	  transcoded non-splitted AVI file.
	- transcode progress label shows, whether started with or
	  without splitting

0.21  Sat Dec 01 2001, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- fixed color problem with snapshot images
	
	New Features:
	- transcode 0.5.1 supports 4GB AVI files, so max.
	  filesize for the bitrate suggestion is now 4000 MB
	  (was 2000 MB with transcode 0.5.0)

0.20  Tue Nov 27 2001, joern
	- First public release. Should be usable but is not tested
	  with thousands of DVDs.
