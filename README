I.   ABOUT

   dvd::rip is a Perl Gtk+ based DVD copy program build on top of a low
   level DVD Ripping API, which uses the Linux Video Stream Processing
   Tool transcode, written by Thomas Oestreich.

   It simplifies the whole process of making copies of your DVDs using a
   straightforward 4 step strategy:

    1. Specify file system storage locations.
    2. Read TOC from DVD, select a title and rip it.
    3. Adjust clipping and zooming parameters.
    4. Set transcode options and go!

   Also dvd::rip has a powerful cluster mode which will use all your
   hardware to increase transcode performance by parallel encoding.

   For the impatient: here is a short list of dvd::rip's major
   features.

   Also the homepage contains an extensive user documentation for
   standard and cluster mode, with screenshots, diagrams and more.
   This README covers only the installation not the usage of dvd::rip.
   
III. INSTALLATION

   This documentation page covers dvd::rip 0.45.

   dvd::rip is a Gtk+ based program written in Perl, using the video
   processing tool transcode for the internals. So you first have to
   comply some prerequisites before installing dvd::rip.

transcode

   dvd::rip delegates all the low level DVD handling to transcode, which
   can be obtained here:

     [3]http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/

   dvd::rip expects all transcode binaries to be found in the standard
   search PATH.

   If you plan to create (S)VCD's you must compile transcode with the
   mjpeg export filter module.

   Note: For almost any Linux distribution exist binary transcode
   packages. Compiling transcode isn't an easy task, so you should try
   binary packages first. Refer to the [4]download page for details.

Image Magick

   For image processing dvd::rip uses the widely distributed software
   package Image Magick, at least the programs identify and convert
   should be installed on your system. All versions above version 4
   should work (actually tested with 5.3.1). dvd::rip does not use Perl
   Magick.

   If your Linux distribution does not ship Image Magick, you can find it
   here:

     [5]http://www.imagemagick.org/

   dvd::rip expects the Image Magick binaries to be found in the standard
   search PATH.

Perl Gtk Module

   For its GUI component dvd::rip needs the Perl Gtk module, which
   presumes Gtk+ version 1.2 or higher. I tested dvd::rip with Perl Gtk
   0.7008.

   You can find the Gtk module on CPAN, e.g.:

     [6]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Gtk/

   Note:
   Perl Gtk detects your installed Gtk libs and build sub components only
   if the correspondent Gtk library was found.

   dvd::rip needs the Gtk::Gdk::Pixbuf component which needs gdk-pixbuf
   to be installed on your system. So first make sure, that gdk-pixbuf is
   installed. Then install Perl Gtk and everything should work as
   expected.

mplayer and/or xine (with a DVD plugin)

   If you have mplayer or xine (with the d4d or dvdnav plugin) installed,
   you can preview selected DVD titles/chapters with the appropriate
   audio channels.

   You can download xine and mplayer from here:

     [7]http://xine.sourceforge.net/
     [8]http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

   dvd::rip expects the player binaries to be found in the standard
   search PATH.

Installing / Updating dvd::rip itself

   This is quite easy, if you have managed installing the packages
   mentioned above... ;)

   [9]Download the .tar.gz archive of the dvd::rip version you want to
   install. Then extract the file, change into the created directory,
   generate the Makefile and execute make:

     # as a normal user
     tar xfz Video-DVDRip-0.45.tar.gz
     cd Video-DVDRip-x.xx
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

   If the "make test" reported no errors, you can install the files into
   your Perl library path. Maybe you must be root to do this:

     # become root
     su
     make install

   You can ommit the "make install" step. But then you can execute the
   'dvdrip' binary only from the build directory, otherwise dvd::rip
   can't find its files.

   Note: If you execute 'make test' as root, you most probably get an
   error message about a missing 'splitpipe' command. This is because
   root hasn't the actual directory in PATH and so dvd::rip can't find
   the splitpipe program. Do only the 'make install' as root. As well for
   security reasons you shouldn't compile packages as root.

   Read the Changes file

   I strongly suggest you reading at least the latest change log entry of
   the Changes file, resp. all entries of the versions you probably
   skipped in case of an update. It contains important release notes,
   e.g. about compatibility issues, and all relevant changes from release
   to release.

Additional steps for cluster mode

   First ensure that you're using transcode version 0.6.0pre4-20020322 or
   better, because cluster mode doesn't work with earlier versions.

Perl modules

   Additionally you need the Storable and the Event Perl modules. You can
   find them on CPAN, e.g.:

     [10]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Storable/
     [11]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Event/

fping and pstree

   The dvd::rip cluster control daemon uses fping to check if nodes are
   online and pstree to get information about specific child processes.
   Both tools should be shipped with your Linux distribution (fping
   sometimes isn't, but you can get it here: [12]http://www.fping.com/).

   Note: Matthias Riese told me that there are IPv6 fping packages which
   don't support IPv4, what's most likely not what you want, so pay
   attention to get the right version ("ipv6" should not occur in the
   package name).

   dvd::rip expects fping to be installed set-uid root (because you
   hopefully don't run dvd::rip as root ;), which is not the default for
   most distributions. Please set the set-uid flag by typing this command
   as root:

     chmod u+s /usr/sbin/fping

   If fping is installed in another location, set a symlink to
   /usr/sbin/fping, because dvd::rip expects it there.

   Note: These steps are necessary only on the computer, where the
   cluster control daemon runs. All slave nodes of a dvd::rip cluster
   only need transcode installed, dvd::rip or any packages mentioned here
   aren't needed there.

IV.  SOURCE DOWNLOAD

   You can download dvd::rip sources from this server or all stable
   releases from any CPAN mirror.

   Local download of the latest stable release:

     [3]Video-DVDRip-0.45.tar.gz

   CPAN download directory:

     [4]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/J/JR/JRED/

   Here you can get a list of CPAN mirrors:

     [5]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/SITES.html

   You can download older versions from here:

     [6]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/
     [7]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/pre/

RPM's and other contributed downloads

   I do not provide RPM archives myself, but other dvd::rip users are so
   kind to build some. You'll find them in my contribution directory,
   beside other interesting donated stuff:

     [8]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/

   Please understand that I can't offer any support for these files.

Debian packages

   Christian Marillat <marillat.christian AT wanadoo.fr> does a great job
   building video related Debian packages and publishing them on his
   website [9]http://marillat.free.fr/. You can use apt-get to install
   the packages if you add the following entries to your
   /etc/apt/sources.list file:
  deb http://marillat.free.fr/ testing main
  deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main

   You will find all packages to compile transcode on your own (if you
   need always the very latest versions), or can get binaries of
   reasonably recent transcode versions directly. The same applies to
   dvd::rip.

SuSE packages

   Rainer Ley maintains several video related SuSE RPM's, including
   transcode and dvd::rip. Refer to his download page:

     [10]http://www6.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~rainer/rpms/

Mandrake packages

   Mandrake users can get actual dvd::rip RPM's from the Penguin
   Liberation Front lair.

     [11]http://plf.zarb.org/

Anonymous CVS access

   Note: this is intended for developers and documentation translators.
   This CVS repository is only a read only mirror of my main repository.
   It's updated manually when I publish releases or pre-releases, so
   there is no advantage for normal users compared to downloading the tar
   balls mentioned above (besides making it easier using "cvs update" ;)

   Root                            Module
   :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs dvdrip

V.   MAILING LIST

   If you want to discuss usage, problems and suggestions with other
   dvd::rip users, you should subscribe to the dvdrip-users mailing list.
   This list is low traffic and announces, patches etc. will be posted
   here, too.

   The language of the mailing list is english, although the author and
   many users and contributors are germans (or at least speak german ;).

   Note: this is a closed mailing list to prevent members from getting
   flooded by spam. So you have to subscribe before posting. Postings
   from non subscribed users may be discarded without notification! Also
   you must use the correct sender address, because the mailing list
   program has no idea of your alternative mail addresses.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: please don't post any illegal stuff here, e.g.
   requests for movie downloads or similar stuff! Mailing list members
   breaking this simple rule will be removed immediately.

     * [3]Mailing list subscription
     * [4]Mailing list archive

   Because dvd::rip is highly transcode related, I suggest subscribing to
   the [5]transcode-user mailing list, too.
