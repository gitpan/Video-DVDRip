I.   ABOUT

   dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It
   provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost
   all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses the widely
   known video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open
   Source tools. dvd::rip itself is licensed under GPL / Perl Artistic
   License.

            "And note: it's spelled dvd::rip, and nothing else."

   This chapter describes how you can get and install dvd::rip. You can
   try one of the several binary distributions or install it from the
   source.

[18]1.1 Binary distributions

   [ [19]Content ] [ [20]Top ]

   Installation of dvd::rip isn't that hard, but fulfilling the
   requirements actually is. So you should first try a binary
   installation using the package manager of your Linux distribution.
   This tracks all dependencies automatcially and should speed up things
   significantly.

[21]1.1.1 Debian packages

   Christian Marillat builds video related Debian packages and publishes
   them on his website [22]http://marillat.free.fr/. You can use apt-get
   to install the packages if you add one of the following entries
   (depending on your distribution) to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:
  deb http://marillat.free.fr/ testing main
  deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main

   You will find all packages to compile transcode on your own (if you
   need always the very latest versions), or can get binaries of
   reasonably recent transcode versions directly. The same applies to
   dvd::rip.

[23]1.1.2 SuSE packages

   Rainer Ley builds dvd::rip SuSE RPM's you can download from the
   contrib directory:

     [24]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/suse/

   On his homepage you find several video related RPM's, including
   transcode:

     [25]http://www6.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~rainer/rpms/

[26]1.1.3 Mandrake packages

   Mandrake users can get actual dvd::rip and transcode RPM's from the
   Penguin Liberation Front lair.

     [27]http://plf.zarb.org/

[28]1.1.4 RedHat packages

   A kind RedHat user (who wants to stay anonymous) builds dvd::rip
   RedHat RPM's, you can download from the contrib directory:

     [29]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/redhat/

[30]1.1.5 RedHat-8.0-only packages

   Michel Alexandre Salim maintains an apt repository with the very
   latest snapshots of transcode and dvd::rip. It's for RedHat 8.0 only:

     [31]http://messlab.sourceforge.net

[32]1.1.6 gentoo packages

   You can get dvd::rip and transcode from the official gentoo package
   repository:

     [33]http://www.gentoo.org/packages/media-video/dvdrip.html

[34]1.2 Source download

   [ [35]Content ] [ [36]Top ]

[37]1.2.1 dvd::rip tarball download

   You can download dvd::rip sources from this server or all stable
   releases from any CPAN mirror.

   Local download of the latest stable release:

     [38]Video-DVDRip-0.48.1.tar.gz

   CPAN download directory: ([39]list of mirrors)

     [40]http://www.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/J/JR/JRED/

   You can download older versions from here:

     [41]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/
     [42]http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/pre/

[43]1.2.2 CVS access

   Note: this is mainly intended for developers. This CVS repository is
   only a read only mirror of my main repository. It's updated manually
   when I publish releases or pre-releases, so there is no advantage for
   normal users compared to downloading the tar balls (besides making it
   easier using "cvs update" ;)

   Root                            Module
   :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs dvdrip

[44]1.3 Install from source

   [ [45]Content ] [ [46]Top ]

[47]1.3.1 Requirements

   dvd::rip is a Gtk+ based program written in Perl, using the video
   processing tool transcode for the internals. So you first have to
   comply some prerequisites before installing dvd::rip.

   dvd::rip expects all command line tools mentioned here to be found in
   the standard search PATH.

[48]1.3.1.1 transcode

   dvd::rip delegates all the low level DVD handling to transcode, which
   can be obtained here:

     [49]http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode
     /

   Version 0.6.1 is recommended, but 0.6.0 should work, too.

   If you plan to create (S)VCD's you must compile transcode with the
   mjpeg export filter module. transcode's internal bbmpeg filter isn't
   supported yet.

   Note: For almost any Linux distribution exist binary transcode
   packages. Compiling transcode isn't an easy task, so you should try
   binary packages first. Refer to the [50]binaries section for details.

[51]1.3.1.2 Image Magick

   For image processing dvd::rip uses the widely distributed software
   package Image Magick, at least the programs identify and convert
   should be installed on your system. All versions above version 4
   should work (actually tested with 5.3.1). dvd::rip does not use Perl
   Magick.

   If your Linux distribution does not ship Image Magick, you can find it
   here:

     [52]http://www.imagemagick.org/

[53]1.3.1.3 ogmtools

   dvd::rip has support for generating audio / video ogg streams (often
   known as OGM streams). You need a recent version of ogmtools for that
   to work:

     [54]http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/index.html

   dvd::rip expects version 0.954 or higher.

[55]1.3.1.4 subtitleripper

   To get subtitles with dvd::rip you need a recent version of the
   subtitleripper package. It's shipped with transcode in the
   contrib/subrip directory. You can use this version for transcode >=
   transcode-0.6.2.20021017. Otherwise fetch it via CVS from the
   subtitleripper homepage:

     [56]http://subtitleripper.sourceforge.net/

[57]1.3.1.5 Perl Gtk Module

   For its GUI component dvd::rip needs the Perl Gtk module, which
   presumes Gtk+ version 1.2 or higher. I tested dvd::rip with Perl Gtk
   0.7008.

   You can find the Gtk module on CPAN, e.g.:

     [58]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Gtk/

   Note:
   Perl Gtk detects your installed Gtk libs and build sub components only
   if the correspondent Gtk library was found.

   dvd::rip needs the Gtk::Gdk::Pixbuf component which needs gdk-pixbuf
   to be installed on your system. So first make sure, that gdk-pixbuf is
   installed. Then install Perl Gtk and everything should work as
   expected.

[59]1.3.1.6 mplayer and/or xine (with a DVD plugin)

   If you have mplayer or xine (with the d4d or dvdnav plugin) installed,
   you can preview selected DVD titles/chapters with the appropriate
   audio channels.

   You can download xine and mplayer from here:

     [60]http://xine.sourceforge.net/
     [61]http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

[62]1.3.1.7 CD burning tools

   If you want to use dvd::rip's [63]CD burning module, you must have the
   following tools installed (in brackets the versions I use, maybe older
   versions work, too, but I recommend these):

     [64]mkisofs (1.15a34)
     [65]cdrecord (0.7.12)
     [66]vcdimager (0.7.12)
     [67]cdrdao (1.1.7)

[68]1.3.1.8 Additional requirements for cluster mode

   Some additional Perl modules and command line tools are needed for the
   cluster mode.

[69]1.3.1.9 Perl modules

   Cluster mode needs the Storable and Event Perl modules. Check if your
   distribution ships them already. If not, you can find them on CPAN:

     [70]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Storable/
     [71]http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Event/

[72]1.3.1.10 fping and pstree

   The dvd::rip cluster control daemon uses fping to check if nodes are
   online and pstree to get information about specific child processes.
   Both tools should be shipped with your Linux distribution (fping
   sometimes isn't, but you can get it here: [73]http://www.fping.com/).

   Note: Matthias Riese told me that there are IPv6 fping packages which
   don't support IPv4, what's most likely not what you want, so pay
   attention to get the right version ("ipv6" should not occur in the
   package name).

   dvd::rip expects fping to be installed set-uid root (because you
   hopefully don't run dvd::rip as root ;), which is not the default for
   most distributions. Please set the set-uid flag by typing this command
   as root:

     chmod u+s /usr/sbin/fping

   If fping is installed in another location, set a symlink to
   /usr/sbin/fping, because dvd::rip expects it there.

   Note: These steps are necessary only on the computer, where the
   cluster control daemon runs. All slave nodes of a dvd::rip cluster
   only need transcode installed, dvd::rip or any packages mentioned here
   aren't needed there.

[74]1.3.2 Install dvd::rip

   This is quite easy, if you have managed installing the packages
   mentioned above... ;)

   [75]Download the .tar.gz archive of the dvd::rip version you want to
   install. Then extract the file, change into the created directory,
   generate the Makefile and execute make:

     # as a normal user
     tar xfz Video-DVDRip-0.48.1.tar.gz
     cd Video-DVDRip-x.xx
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test

   If the "make test" reported no errors, you can install the files into
   your Perl library path. Maybe you must be root to do this:

     # become root
     su
     make install

   You can ommit the "make install" step. But then you can execute the
   'dvdrip' binary only from the build directory, otherwise dvd::rip
   can't find its files.

[76]1.3.3 Update dvd::rip

   Updating is just like installing. The only thing you should be aware
   of is switching the underlying Perl version. This way you easily can
   get two versions of dvd::rip installed in your system, because
   dvd::rip installs its libraries in your Perl library directory. Such a
   installation mixing isn't recommended unless you know exactly what
   you're doing. So it's better to remove the old version from the old
   Perl directory if you change the Perl version.
   Read the Changes file

   I strongly suggest you reading at least the latest change log entry of
   the Changes file, resp. all entries of the versions you probably
   skipped in case of an update. It contains important release notes,
   e.g. about compatibility issues, and all relevant changes from release
   to release.

V.   MAILING LIST

   If you want to discuss usage, problems and suggestions with other
   dvd::rip users, you should subscribe to the dvdrip-users mailing list.
   This list is low traffic and announces, patches etc. will be posted
   here, too.

   The language of the mailing list is english, although the author and
   many users and contributors are germans (or at least speak german ;).

   Note: this is a closed mailing list to prevent members from getting
   flooded by spam. So you have to subscribe before posting. Postings
   from non subscribed users may be discarded without notification! Also
   you must use the correct sender address, because the mailing list
   program has no idea of your alternative mail addresses.

   Before posting any questions or bug reports: please first check the
   [3]documentation, in particular the [4]FAQ.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: please don't post any illegal stuff here, e.g.
   requests for movie downloads or similar stuff! Mailing list members
   breaking this simple rule will be removed immediately.

     * [5]Mailing list subscription
     * [6]Mailing list archive

   Because dvd::rip is highly transcode related, I suggest subscribing to
   the [7]transcode-user mailing list, too.

VII. CHANGES
   $Id: Changes,v 1.122.2.1 2002/11/23 13:46:00 joern Exp $

   Revision history for dvd::rip 0.47 and newer. See Changes.0.46
   for older releases.

   0.48.1 Sat 23 Nov 2002, joern
	Note:
	- transcode 0.6.2 was released on 22. November. dvd::rip
	  works with all 0.6 releases, but 0.6.2 is recommended.
	  dvd::rip disables some features for smaller versions.
	
	Features:
	- Added 64 kbit/s audio bitrate preset entry. Suggested by
	  Miguel J. Jimenez <cactus_espinado AT yahoo.es>
	- ffmpeg video codec setting adjusted to the new ffmpeg
	  interface of transcode 0.6.2. Thanks for the hint to
	  Stefano <stefano AT symbola.it>
	- subtitleripper version is now checked, a correspondent
	  note is printed, if a version smaller than 0.3 is detected.
	  Arne Driescher build a transcode independent tarball
	  of this release, which you can get from Sourceforge:
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleripper

	Bugfixes:
	- Burning tab: label information followed file selection only
	  on the GUI, but old values were used internally.
	- IFO file copying didn't work for DVD image projects. Thanks
	  for the report to Arne Driescher.
	- thranduil <thranduil AT free.fr> reported that dvd::rip's
	  vcdimager command works only with long options. I can't
	  reproduce this, but I switched over to the long options,
	  just to be sure.
