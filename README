I.   ABOUT

   dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It
   provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost
   all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses the widely
   known video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open Source
   tools. dvd::rip itself is licensed under GPL / Perl Artistic License.

            "And note: it's spelled dvd::rip, and nothing else."

     _________________________________________________________________

   This chapter describes how you can get and install dvd::rip. You can
   try one of the several binary distributions or install it from the
   source.

1.1 Binary distributions

   Installation of dvd::rip isn't that hard, but fulfilling the
   requirements actually is (simply because they are a lot ;). So you
   should first try a binary installation using the package manager of
   your Linux distribution. This should track all dependencies
   automatically and speed up things significantly.

1.1.1 Debian packages

   Christian Marillat builds video related Debian packages and publishes
   them on his website http://marillat.free.fr/. You can use apt-get to
   install the packages if you add one of the following entries
   (depending on your distribution) to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://marillat.free.fr/ testing main
deb http://marillat.free.fr/ unstable main

   You will find all packages to compile transcode on your own (if you
   need always the very latest versions), or can get binaries of
   reasonably recent transcode versions directly. The same applies to
   dvd::rip.

1.1.2 SuSE packages

   Rainer Ley builds dvd::rip SuSE RPM's you can download from the
   contrib directory:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/suse/

   On packman.links2linux.de you find several video related RPM's,
   including transcode:

     http://packman.links2linux.de/index.php4

1.1.3 Mandrake packages

   Mandrake users can get actual dvd::rip and transcode RPM's from the
   Penguin Liberation Front lair.

     http://plf.zarb.org/

1.1.4 RedHat packages

   A kind RedHat user (who wants to stay anonymous) builds dvd::rip
   RedHat RPM's, you can download from the contrib directory:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/redhat/

1.1.5 More RedHat packages

   Matthias Saou builds dvd::rip packages you can find at freshrpms.net:

     http://freshrpms.net/rpm/perl-Video-DVDRip

1.1.6 gentoo packages

   You can get dvd::rip and transcode from the official gentoo package
   repository:

     http://www.gentoo.org/packages/media-video/dvdrip.html

1.2 Source download

1.2.1 dvd::rip tarball download

   You can download dvd::rip sources from this server or all stable
   releases from any CPAN mirror.

   Local download of the latest stable release:

     Video-DVDRip-0.50.8.tar.gz

   CPAN download directory: (list of mirrors)

     http://www.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/J/JR/JRED/

   You can download older versions from here:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/
     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/pre/

   This is a directory, which contains several user contributed files,
   you probably find useful:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/

1.2.2 CVS access

   This is mainly intended for developers. This CVS repository is only a
   read only mirror of my main repository. It's updated manually when I
   publish releases or pre-releases, so there is no advantage for normal
   users compared to downloading the tar balls (besides making it easier
   using "cvs update" ;)

   Since development of dvd::rip is divided into two branches, you get
   the current (unstable) version, if you don't specifiy a release tag.
   If you want to access a stable version, add -r rel-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH
   to your cvs checkout command (example: for 0.48.5 this is -r
   rel-0-48-5). All subsequent updates will stay on this branch (here:
   0.48). The easiest way of switching to another branch, is creating a
   new checkout using the corresponding release tag.

   Root                            Module Unstable tag Stable tag
   :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs dvdrip none         rel-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH

1.2.2.1 CVS examples

   Checkout a stable/bugfix version (here 0.48.5) with:

cvs -z9 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout -r rel-0-48-5 dvdrip

   Checkout the current development version with:

cvs -z9 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout dvdrip

   Update a checkout - created using one of the commands above - with:

cd dvdrip; cvs -z9 update

1.3 Requirements

   dvd::rip is a Gtk+ based program written in Perl, using the video
   processing tool transcode and many other tools for the internals. So
   you first have to get some prerequisites before installing dvd::rip.

   dvd::rip expects all command line tools mentioned here to be found in
   the standard search PATH.

1.3.1 Brief overview

   This table gives a brief overview of the tools used by dvd::rip
   (everything but the Perl modules - see the chapters below for more
   information about them). Most tools are optional - the corresponding
   dvd::rip modules are just switched off, if you don't have them.

   But you need at least the tools marked mandatory, otherwise dvd::rip
   will complain with an error message on startup. You can get also a
   dvd::rip window listing this information, refer to the corresponding
   chapter in the documentation for details.

   Tool Comment Mandatory Suggested Minimum Maximum
   transcode dvd::rip is nothing without transcode Yes 0.6.3 0.6.2 -
   ImageMagick Needed for preview image processing Yes 5.5.3 4.0.0 -
   subtitle2pgm Needed for subtitles No 0.3 0.3 -
   rar Needed for compressed subtitles No 2.71 2.71 2.99
   mplayer Needed for subtitle vobsub viewing No 0.90 0.90 -
   ogmtools Needed for OGG/Vorbis No 0.972 0.960 -
   mjpegtools Needed for (S)VCD encoding No 1.6.0 1.6.0 -
   cdrdao Needed for (S)VCD burning No 1.1.7 1.1.7 -
   vcdimager Needed for (S)VCD burning No 0.7.12 0.7.12 -
   mkisofs Needed for AVI/OGG burning No 2.0 1.15 -
   cdrecord Needed for AVI/OGG burning No 2.0 0.7.12 -
   xine Can be used to view DVD's/files No 0.9.15 0.9.13 -
   fping Only for cluster mode master No 2.4 2.2 -

   The following chapters describe the needed tools in detail, including
   information on how to get them. Additionally to the table above all
   need Perl modules are described also.

1.3.2 Perl 5.6.0 or better

   You need a recent Perl version on your system. Perl 5.8.0 is
   recommended, 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 should work also. dvd::rip won't start
   with Perl versions prior to 5.6.0. Actual distributions ship minimum
   5.6.1, so this shouldn't be a real problem, anyway.

1.3.3 Perl Gtk Module

   For its GUI component dvd::rip needs the Perl Gtk module, which
   presumes Gtk+ version 1.2 or higher. I tested dvd::rip with Perl Gtk
   0.7008.

   You can find the Gtk module on CPAN, e.g.:

     http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Gtk/

   Note:
   Perl Gtk detects your installed Gtk libs and build subcomponents only
   if the correspondent Gtk library was found.

   dvd::rip needs the Gtk::Gdk::Pixbuf component which needs gdk-pixbuf
   to be installed on your system. So first make sure, that gdk-pixbuf is
   installed. Then install Perl Gtk and everything should work as
   expected.

1.3.4 transcode

   dvd::rip delegates all the low level video processing to transcode,
   which can be obtained from here:

     http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/

   dvd::rip should work with the latest transcode releases (at least with
   the latest major stable release). Otherwise correspondent notes are
   added to the release notes resp. posted on the homepage.

   If you plan to create (S)VCD's you must compile transcode with the
   mjpeg export filter module. transcode's internal bbmpeg filter isn't
   supported yet.

   Note: For almost any Linux distribution binary transcode packages can
   be found. Compiling transcode sometimes isn't an easy task, in
   particular if you are not familiar with building packages, which have
   lots of dependencies. So you should try binary packages first. Refer
   to the binaries section for details.

1.3.5 Image Magick

   For image processing dvd::rip uses the widely distributed software
   package Image Magick, at least the programs identify and convert
   should be installed on your system.

   If your Linux distribution does not ship Image Magick, you can find it
   here:

     http://www.imagemagick.org/

1.3.6 ogmtools

   dvd::rip has support for generating audio / video ogg streams (often
   known as OGM streams). You need a recent version of ogmtools for that
   to work:

     http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/index.html

1.3.7 subtitleripper

   To get subtitles with dvd::rip you need a recent version of the
   subtitleripper package. It's shipped with transcode in the
   contrib/subrip directory or you can fetch it from the subtitleripper
   homepage:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleripper

1.3.8 mplayer and/or xine (with a DVD plugin)

   If you have mplayer or xine (with the d4d or dvdnav plugin) installed,
   you can preview selected DVD titles/chapters with the appropriate
   audio channels.

   You can download xine and mplayer from here:

     http://xine.sourceforge.net/
     http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

1.3.9 CD burning tools

   If you want to use dvd::rip's CD burning module, you must have the
   following tools installed:

     mkisofs
     cdrecord
     vcdimager
     cdrdao

1.3.10 rar (for vobsub compression)

   MPlayer supports vobsub files compressed with rar, but you need a 2.x
   version, 3.x and higher doesn't work. You can get a 2.x version
   locally from here:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin

   I suggest to install the binary to e.g. /usr/local/bin. Then configure
   this path using the Preferences dialog.

1.3.11 Additional requirements for cluster mode

   Some additional Perl modules and command line tools are needed for the
   cluster mode.

1.3.11.1 Perl modules

   Cluster mode needs the Storable and Event Perl modules. Check if your
   distribution ships them already. If not, you can find them on CPAN:

     http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Storable/
     http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Event/

1.3.11.2 fping

   The dvd::rip cluster control daemon uses fping to check if nodes are
   online. If fping isn't shipped with your Linux distribution you can
   get it from here:

     http://www.fping.com/

   Note: Matthias Riese told me that there are IPv6 fping packages which
   don't support IPv4, which is most likely not what you want, so pay
   attention to get the right version ("ipv6" should not occur in the
   package name).

   dvd::rip expects fping to be installed set-uid root (because you
   hopefully don't run dvd::rip as root ;), which is not the default for
   most distributions. Please set the set-uid flag by typing this command
   as root:

chmod u+s /usr/sbin/fping

   If fping is installed in another location, set a symlink to
   /usr/sbin/fping, because dvd::rip expects it there.

   Note: These steps are necessary only on the computer, where the
   cluster control daemon runs. All slave nodes of a dvd::rip cluster
   only need transcode installed, dvd::rip or any packages mentioned here
   aren't needed there.

1.4 Install from source

1.4.1 Install dvd::rip

   This is quite easy, if you have managed to install the packages
   mentioned above... ;)

   Download the .tar.gz archive of the dvd::rip version you want to
   install. Then extract the file, change into the created directory,
   generate the Makefile and execute make:

# as a normal user
tar xfz Video-DVDRip-0.50.8.tar.gz
cd Video-DVDRip-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

   If the "make test" reported no errors, you can install the files into
   your Perl library path. Usually you must be root to do this:

# become root
su
make install

   You can ommit the "make install" step. But then you can execute the
   'dvdrip' binary only from the build directory and you must put "."
   into your PATH, otherwise dvd::rip can't find its files.

1.4.2 Update dvd::rip

   Updating is just like installing. The only thing you should be aware
   of is switching the underlying Perl version. This way you easily can
   get two versions of dvd::rip installed in your system, because
   dvd::rip installs its libraries in your Perl library directory. Such a
   installation mixing isn't recommended unless you know exactly what
   you're doing. So it's better to remove the old version from the old
   Perl directory if you change the Perl version (refer to the uninstall
   chapter for details).
   Read the Changes file!

   I strongly suggest you should read at least the latest change log
   entry of the Changes file, resp. all entries of the versions you
   probably skipped in case of an update. It contains important release
   notes, e.g. about compatibility issues, and all relevant changes from
   release to release.

   Note:
   Changes on the unstable branch are logged in the file
   Changes.unstable.

1.4.3 Multiple dvd::rip versions in parallel

   It's possible to use several dvd::rip versions in parallel on your
   system, but you can install only one version using make install into
   your system directories.

   Just extract another dvd::rip version you want to use somewhere, enter
   the created directory (Video-DVDRip-x.xx) and execute perl Makefile.PL
   && make here (no make install). Add the actual directory to your PATH
   (export PATH=.:$PATH) and you can start this version with ./dvdrip
   from this directory. All files and libraries located in the actual
   distribution directory will be used. The . in PATH is neccessary,
   otherwise some dvd::rip helper binaries may be taken from another
   place.

tar xvfz Video-DVDRip-0.50.8.tar.gz
cd Video-DVDRip-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL && make
export PATH=.:$PATH
./dvdrip

1.5 Uninstall dvd::rip

   If you didn't use a package manager to install dvd::rip and you want
   to uninstall it, follow these instructions. This is necessary, if you
   accidentally mixed several versions on your system, which may result
   in a broken dvd::rip at all. In this case best thing is to remove all
   instances and to do a clean installation afterwards.

   dvd::rip mainly consists of a bunch of Perl modules which reside in
   the Perl library directory of your Perl interpreter. Easiest way to
   find this directory is to use the locate program. Then a few
   executables belong to dvd::rip, which also can be found using locate.
   This is an example session of how this works:

% locate DVDRip.pm
/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.0/Video/DVDRip.pm
% rm -r /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.0/Video/DVDRip*
% locate dvdrip
/usr/bin/dvdrip
/usr/bin/dvdrip-master
% rm /usr/bin/{dvdrip,dvdrip-master,dr_splitpipe,dr_progress,dr_exec}

   In words: find a Perl library directory called Video with DVDRip.pm in
   it. Remove the DVDRip.pm file and the subdirectory called DVDRip. Then
   find the location of the binaries and remove them - see the list
   above. If you find multiple instances this way, remove them all.

Contacting the author

   You can contact me by mail: [3]Jörn Reder <joern AT zyn.de>. Please
   place the word "dvd::rip" everywhere in the subject, in addition to
   your real topic, because this helps me classifying your email
   correctly. Thanks.

   I'm native german speaker, so you can send your mails in german, if
   you want. The others have to accept my rough english ;)

   And: consider subscription and posting to the [4]dvdrip-users mailing
   list list (Note: language in the list is english).

Reporting bugs and suggestions

   If you're going to send me a bug report, patch or feature request,
   please make sure, that you're using the most recent version of
   dvd::rip (at least the latest stable release). Please first check the
   [5]documentation, in particular the [6]FAQ, the [7]ChangeLog and the
   [8]mailing list archive to see, if the bug is reported and probably
   fixed already in the development release. For feature requests, please
   check if it's not already noted on my [9]TODO list. I know reading
   documentation is boring, but it saves time ;) Thanks.

   If you find a bug, please report it and add the following information:
     * information about your Linux installation, which may be
       interesting (at least the distribution you're using)
     * information about your Perl installation. Simply send me the
       output of the "perl -V" command (only necessary in case of an
       internal error message or fatal crash)
     * version numbers of all tools which are affected (at least
       transcode) - you can get a list of all version numbers by pressing
       Ctrl+D in the dvd::rip main window.
     * a description of how the bug can be reproduced.

transcode related issues

   If you encounter problems ripping specific DVDs, this is probably a
   transcode problem. Maybe you want to report this directly to the
   transcode developers resp. to the [10]transcode-user list. If you're
   not sure about this, report the problem to me or the dvdrip-users
   list, and we'll see, what we can do for you.

Contribute with patches

   Patches are welcome. I prefer unified context diffs created this way
   (if you're familiar with CVS, you should use the [11]CVS repository
   and create patches with CVS):
  cd Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched
  make realclean
  cd ..
  diff -urN Video-DVDRip-0.48.2 Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched > patchfile.txt

   where Video-DVDRip-0.48.2 is the root directory of the original
   distribution and Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched your modified version.
   Without the make realclean all files created during make are added to
   the patch, what's not what we want.

Credits and privacy

   If users send me patches, suggestions or bug reports, I add them with
   their name and email address to the ChangeLog, Credits and COPYRIGHT
   files. If you are concerned about privacy, then please tell me that
   you don't want to be listed and I omit that. I fully understand if
   privacy matters for you.

VI. CHANGES
   $Id: Changes,v 1.131.2.16 2003/03/06 22:08:23 joern Exp $

   Revision history and release notes for dvd::rip.

   0.50.8 [stable branch] Thu 6 Mar 2003, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Cluster mode: dvdrip-master daemon bailed out with an
	  error message on startup. Thanks for the report to
	  David Chan <davidchan AT rcn.com>.
	- Cluster mode: if file cleanup was requested and file
	  splitting not necessary (because the file is smaller
	  than one disc) the transcoded file was removed.
