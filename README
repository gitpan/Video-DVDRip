I.   ABOUT

   dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It
   provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost
   all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses the widely
   known video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open Source
   tools. dvd::rip itself is licensed under GPL / Perl Artistic License.

             "And note: it's spelt dvd::rip, and nothing else."

     _________________________________________________________________

   This chapter describes how you can get and install dvd::rip. You can
   try one of the several binary distributions or install it from the
   source.

1.1 Binary distributions

   Installation of dvd::rip isn't that hard, but fulfilling the
   requirements actually is (simply because they are a lot ;). So you
   should first try a binary installation using the package manager of
   your Linux distribution. This should track all dependencies
   automatically and speed up things significantly.

1.1.1 Debian packages

   Christian Marillat builds video related Debian packages and publishes
   them on his website http://hpisi.nerim.net/. You can use apt-get to
   install the packages if you add one of the following entries
   (depending on your distribution) to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat stable main
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat testing main
deb ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat unstable main

   You will find all packages to compile transcode on your own (if you
   need always the very latest versions), or can get binaries of
   reasonably recent transcode versions directly. The same applies to
   dvd::rip.

   The dvd::rip package is called dvdrip.

1.1.2 SuSE packages

   On packman.links2linux.org you find several video related RPM's,
   including dvd::rip and transcode:

     dvd::rip at packman.links2linux.org
     http://packman.links2linux.org/ homepage

1.1.3 Mandrake packages

   Mandrake users can get actual dvd::rip and transcode RPM's from the
   Penguin Liberation Front lair.

     http://plf.zarb.org/

1.1.4 RedHat packages

   Matthias Saou does a great job in building dvd::rip and other
   multimedia related packages. You can find them at freshrpms.net. This
   is a direct link the dvd::rip package:

     http://freshrpms.net/rpm/perl-Video-DVDRip

1.1.5 gentoo packages

   You can get dvd::rip and transcode from the official gentoo package
   repository:

     http://packages.gentoo.org/search/?sstring=dvdrip

1.1.6 FreeBSD port

   dvd::rip is available in the FreeBSD ports collection. To install from
   source, cd to ${PORTSDIR}/multimedia/dvdrip and type 'make install
   clean'. To install a binary package of the port, type 'pkg_add -r
   dvdrip'. Note however that the default installation of the transcode
   port which dvd::rip depends on is very minimalistic, it is recommended
   to look at the Makefile of the transcode port, enable all the options
   you need for dvd::rip and install the transcode port from source.
   Thanks to Michael Nottebrock, who maintains the FreeBSD port.

1.1.7 OpenBSD port

   Since June 2004 we have also an official OpenBSD port of dvd::rip. You
   find it under graphics/dvdrip. Thanks to the maintainer Waldemar
   Brodkorb.

1.2 Source download

1.2.1 dvd::rip tarball download

   You can download dvd::rip sources from this server or all stable
   releases from any CPAN mirror.

   Local download of the latest stable release:

     Video-DVDRip-0.97.4.tar.gz
     Video-DVDRip-0.97.4.tar.gz.asc (GnuPG signature, get key)

   Local download of the latest unstable release:

     Video-DVDRip-0.97.4.tar.gz
     Video-DVDRip-0.97.4.tar.gz.asc (GnuPG signature, get key)

   CPAN download directory: (list of mirrors)

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/J/JR/JRED/

   You can download older versions from here:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/
     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/dist/pre/

   This is a directory, which contains several user contributed files,
   you probably find useful:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/

1.2.2 CVS access

   This is mainly intended for developers and CVS experienced users. This
   CVS repository is only a read only mirror of my main repository. It's
   updated manually when I publish releases or pre-releases, so there is
   no advantage for normal users compared to downloading the tar balls
   (besides making it easier using "cvs update" ;)

   Since development of dvd::rip is divided into two branches, you get
   the current (unstable) version, if you don't specifiy a release tag.
   If you want to access a stable version, add -r rel-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH
   to your cvs checkout command (example: for 0.48.5 this is -r
   rel-0-48-5). If you always want to have the latest stable patch
   release, use -r rel-MAJOR-MINOR-patches (e.g. -r rel-0-50-patches).
   All subsequent updates will stay on this branch (here: 0.50). The
   easiest way of switching to another branch is creating a new checkout
   using the corresponding release tag.

   Root                            Module Unstable tag Stable tag
   :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs dvdrip none         rel-MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH

1.2.2.1 CVS examples

   Log into CVS server with:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs login

          (Press ENTER for password)

   Checkout latest version of the actual stable branch (here 0.50.x):

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout -r rel-0-50-patches dvdrip

   Checkout a specific stable/bugfix version (here 0.50.13) with:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout -r rel-0-50-13 dvdrip

   Checkout the current development version with:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.exit1.org:/cvs checkout dvdrip

   Update a checkout - created using one of the commands above - with:

cd dvdrip; cvs -z3 update

1.3 Requirements

   dvd::rip is a Gtk+ based program written in Perl, using the video
   processing tool transcode and many other tools for the internals. So
   you first have to get some prerequisites before installing dvd::rip.

   dvd::rip expects all command line tools mentioned here to be found in
   the standard search PATH.

1.3.1 Brief overview

   This table gives a brief overview of the tools used by dvd::rip
   (everything but the Perl modules - see the chapters below for more
   information about them). Most tools are optional - the corresponding
   dvd::rip modules are just switched off, if you don't have them.

   But you need at least the tools marked mandatory, otherwise dvd::rip
   will complain with an error message on startup. You can get also a
   dvd::rip window listing this information, refer to the corresponding
   chapter in the documentation for details.

   Tool Comment Mandatory Suggested Minimum Maximum
   transcode dvd::rip is nothing without transcode Yes 0.6.14 0.6.2 -

   xine Can be used to view DVD's/files No 0.9.15 0.9.13 -
   fping Only for cluster mode master No 2.4 2.2 -

   The following chapters describe the needed tools in detail, including
   information on how to get them. Additionally to the table above all
   need Perl modules are described also.

1.3.2 Perl 5.6.0 or better

   You need a recent Perl version on your system. Perl 5.8.0 is
   recommended, 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 should work also. dvd::rip won't start
   with Perl versions prior to 5.6.0. Actual distributions ship minimum
   5.6.1, so this shouldn't be a real problem, anyway.

1.3.3 Perl Gtk Module

   For its GUI component dvd::rip needs the Perl Gtk module, which
   presumes Gtk+ version 1.2 or higher. I tested dvd::rip with Perl Gtk
   0.7008.

   You can find the Gtk module on CPAN, e.g.:

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Gtk/

   Note:
   Perl Gtk detects your installed Gtk libs and build subcomponents only
   if the correspondent Gtk library was found.

   dvd::rip needs the Gtk::Gdk::Pixbuf component which needs gdk-pixbuf
   to be installed on your system. So first make sure, that gdk-pixbuf is
   installed. Then install Perl Gtk and everything should work as
   expected.

1.3.3.1 Additional notes on building Perl Gtk (e.g. on Slackware)

   Stephen D. Leedle <LeedleSt AT gmx.de> sent me these instructions,
   which describe how to build the Perl Gtk module on Slackware - but
   this should work for other distributions / operation systems which
   lack a complete Perl Gtk package also.

   First install the Perl modules XML::Parser and XML::Writer. If your
   distribution doesn't ship them, download the tarballs from here:

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/XML-Parser-2.34.tar.gz
     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/XML-Writer-0.520.tar.gz

   They are neccessary for compiling the Gtk Perl module. Extract each of
   both packages, descend into the directories, do following:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test # (If You're keen on this, there might be no test...)
make install
# (The same procedure for the second one.)

   Get the source code for the Perl Gtk module as described above. Unpack
   and descend into directory and enter the following:

perl Makefile.PL --without-guessing # this option is important
make
make test # (Again, the test is not mandatory)
make install

   Now, the trick is following: by adding the --without-guessing option
   we got only very basic Gtk-Perl stuff. So we need to manually compile
   the Gtk::Gdk::Pixbuf module. Descend into the
   Gtk-Perl-0.7009/GdkPixBuf directory, and do again:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

   Now install the dvd::rip program as neccessary and hopefully - enjoy!

1.3.4 Locale::TextDomain

   Since version 0.52.0 dvd::rip is localized and uses the Perl modul
   Locale::TextDomain for that. Most Linux distributions ship the module
   as libintl-perl.

   If you want to install it from source you can get it from CPAN, as
   usual:

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Locale/

   The tarball is called libintl-perl-x.xx.tar.gz.

1.3.5 transcode

   dvd::rip delegates all the low level video processing to transcode,
   which can be obtained from here:

     http://www.transcoding.org/
     http://www.theorie.physik.uni-goettingen.de/~ostreich/transcode/
     (old page)

   dvd::rip should work with the latest transcode releases (at least with
   the latest major stable release). Otherwise correspondent notes are
   added to the release notes resp. posted on the homepage.

   If you plan to create (S)VCD's you must compile transcode with the
   mjpeg export filter module. transcode's internal bbmpeg filter isn't
   supported yet.

   Note: For almost any Linux distribution binary transcode packages can
   be found. Compiling transcode sometimes isn't an easy task, in
   particular if you are not familiar with building packages, which have
   lots of dependencies. So you should try binary packages first. Refer
   to the binaries section for details.

1.3.6 Image Magick

   For image processing dvd::rip uses the widely distributed software
   package Image Magick, at least the programs identify and convert
   should be installed on your system.

   If your Linux distribution does not ship Image Magick, you can find it
   here:

     http://www.imagemagick.org/

1.3.7 xvid4conf

   If you have transcode >= 0.6.9 you can use the xvid4 export module,
   which is transcode's binding to the upcoming XviD 1.0, resp. the
   dev-api-4 branch of xvidcore. With xvid4conf you can tweak all
   settings of the codec to increase quality.

     http://zebra.fh-weingarten.de/~transcode/xvid4conf/

1.3.8 ogmtools

   dvd::rip has support for generating audio / video ogg streams (often
   known as OGM streams). You need a recent version of ogmtools for that
   to work:

     http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/ogmtools/index.html

1.3.9 subtitleripper

   To get subtitles with dvd::rip you need a recent version of the
   subtitleripper package. It's shipped with transcode in the
   contrib/subrip directory or you can fetch it from the subtitleripper
   homepage:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleripper

1.3.10 mplayer and/or xine (with a DVD plugin)

   If you have mplayer or xine installed, you can preview selected DVD
   titles/chapters with the appropriate audio channels.

   You can download xine and mplayer from here:

     http://xine.sourceforge.net/
     http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

1.3.11 CD burning tools

   If you want to use dvd::rip's CD burning module, you must have the
   following tools installed:

     mkisofs
     cdrecord
     vcdimager
     cdrdao

1.3.12 rar (for vobsub compression)

   MPlayer supports vobsub files compressed with rar, but you need a 2.x
   version, 3.x and higher doesn't work. You can get a 2.x version
   locally from here:

     http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/contrib/rarlnx271.sfx.bin

   I suggest to install the binary to e.g. /usr/local/bin. Then configure
   this path using the Preferences dialog.

1.3.13 Additional requirements for cluster mode

   Some additional Perl modules and command line tools are needed for the
   cluster mode.

1.3.13.1 Perl modules

   Cluster mode needs the Storable and Event Perl modules. Check if your
   distribution ships them already. If not, you can find them on CPAN:

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Storable/
     http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Event/

1.3.13.2 fping

   The dvd::rip cluster control daemon uses fping to check if nodes are
   online. If fping isn't shipped with your Linux distribution you can
   get it from here:

     http://www.fping.com/

   Note: Matthias Riese told me that there are IPv6 fping packages which
   don't support IPv4, which is most likely not what you want, so pay
   attention to get the right version ("ipv6" should not occur in the
   package name).

   dvd::rip expects fping to be installed set-uid root (because you
   hopefully don't run dvd::rip as root ;), which is not the default for
   most distributions. Please set the set-uid flag by typing this command
   as root:

chmod u+s /usr/sbin/fping

   If fping is installed in another location, set a symlink to
   /usr/sbin/fping, because dvd::rip expects it there.

   Note: These steps are necessary only on the computer, where the
   cluster control daemon runs. All slave nodes of a dvd::rip cluster
   only need transcode installed, dvd::rip or any packages mentioned here
   aren't needed there.

1.4 Install from source

1.4.1 Install dvd::rip

   This is quite easy, if you have managed to install the packages
   mentioned above... ;)

   Download the .tar.gz archive of the dvd::rip version you want to
   install. Then extract the file, change into the created directory,
   generate the Makefile and execute make:

# as a normal user
tar xfz Video-DVDRip-0.97.4.tar.gz
cd Video-DVDRip-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

   If the "make test" reported no errors, you can install the files into
   your Perl library path. Usually you must be root to do this:

# become root
su
make install

   You can ommit the "make install" step. But then you can execute the
   'dvdrip' binary only from the build directory and you must put "."
   into your PATH, otherwise dvd::rip can't find its files.

1.4.2 Update dvd::rip

   Updating is just like installing. The only thing you should be aware
   of is switching the underlying Perl version. This way you easily can
   get two versions of dvd::rip installed in your system, because
   dvd::rip installs its libraries in your Perl library directory. Such a
   installation mixing isn't recommended unless you know exactly what
   you're doing. So it's better to remove the old version from the old
   Perl directory if you change the Perl version (refer to the uninstall
   chapter for details).
   Read the Changes file!

   I strongly suggest you should read at least the latest change log
   entry of the Changes file, resp. all entries of the versions you
   probably skipped in case of an update. It contains important release
   notes, e.g. about compatibility issues, and all relevant changes from
   release to release.

   Note:
   Changes on the unstable branch are logged in the file
   Changes.unstable.

1.4.3 Multiple dvd::rip versions in parallel

   It's possible to use several dvd::rip versions in parallel on your
   system, but you can install only one version using make install into
   your system directories.

   Just extract another dvd::rip version you want to use somewhere, enter
   the created directory (Video-DVDRip-x.xx) and execute perl Makefile.PL
   && make here (no make install). Add the actual directory to your PATH
   (export PATH=.:$PATH) and you can start this version with ./dvdrip
   from this directory. All files and libraries located in the actual
   distribution directory will be used. The . in PATH is neccessary,
   otherwise some dvd::rip helper binaries may be taken from another
   place.

tar xvfz Video-DVDRip-0.97.4.tar.gz
cd Video-DVDRip-x.xx
perl Makefile.PL && make
export PATH=.:$PATH
./dvdrip

1.5 Uninstall dvd::rip

   If you didn't use a package manager to install dvd::rip and you want
   to uninstall it, follow these instructions. This is necessary, if you
   accidentally mixed several versions on your system, which may result
   in a broken dvd::rip at all. In this case best thing is to remove all
   instances and to do a clean installation afterwards.

   dvd::rip mainly consists of a bunch of Perl modules which reside in
   the Perl library directory of your Perl interpreter. Easiest way to
   find this directory is to use the locate program. Then a few
   executables belong to dvd::rip, which also can be found using locate.
   This is an example session of how this works:

% locate DVDRip.pm
/usr/local/share/perl/5.8.0/Video/DVDRip.pm
% rm -r /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.0/Video/DVDRip*
% locate dvdrip
/usr/bin/dvdrip
/usr/bin/dvdrip-master
% rm /usr/bin/{dvdrip,dvdrip-master,dr_splitpipe,dr_progress,dr_exec}

   In words: find a Perl library directory called Video with DVDRip.pm in
   it. Remove the DVDRip.pm file and the subdirectory called DVDRip. Then
   find the location of the binaries and remove them - see the list
   above. If you find multiple instances this way, remove them all.

V.  SUPPORT

Getting help

   If you encounter problems, which are not covered by the
   [3]documentation, in particular the [4]FAQ, subscribe to the
   [5]dvdrip-users mailing list and ask your question there (but not
   before you read all information on this page!).

   Eric S. Raymond wrote an excellent article about [6]"How To Ask
   Questions The Smart Way ". You probably want to take a look at it
   before posting ;)

Reporting bugs and suggestions (*please* read this!)

   If you want to send a bug report, patch or feature request, please
   make sure, that you're using the most recent version of dvd::rip (at
   least the latest stable release). Also first check the
   [7]documentation, in particular the [8]FAQ, the [9]ChangeLog and the
   [10]mailing list archive to see, if the bug is reported and probably
   fixed already in the development release. For feature requests, please
   check if it's not already noted on the [11]TODO list. We all know,
   reading documentation is boring, but it saves time ;) Thanks.

   It's really important that you add the following information to your
   bug reports, otherwise you'll likely don't get any helpful answers
   (probably no answer at all, because for most people it's boring to ask
   for this again and again...):
     * a description of how the bug can be reproduced.
     * information about your Linux installation, in particular which
       distribution/version you are using
     * exact versions of all affected packages. That's always dvd::rip
       and transcode, but often a bunch of other packages are important,
       e.g. ogmtools (if it's about ogg/vorbis) or mjpegtools (if it's
       about (S)VCD processing) and so on. You can get a list of most of
       these version numbers by pressing Ctrl+D in the dvd::rip main
       window.
     * information about usage of binary packages or self compiled
       packages. In case of binary packages: from where did you get them.
     * if dvd::rip crashes or it looks like an internal dvd::rip bug and
       not like a bug of external command execution, add the output of
       "perl -V".
     * if a specific command executed by dvd::rip fails, grab the
       corresponding command line from the log and execute it by hand. It
       is important that you add the complete command line and the
       complete command output to your report.

transcode related issues

   If dvd::rip mainly works for you but you encounter problems ripping
   specific DVDs, this is probably a transcode problem. Maybe you want to
   report this directly to the transcode developers resp. to the
   [12]transcode-users list. If you're not sure about this, report the
   problem to the dvdrip-users list, and we'll see, what we can do for
   you. But aware, that you may be pointed to the transcode-users list...
   ;)

Encrypted DVD's

   Please note: copying encrypted DVD's is illegal in many countries.
   Also it's illegal to provide information about how this could be
   accomplished. So don't send any questions regarding encrypted DVD's or
   DVD cracking to the author of dvd::rip or to the dvd::rip mailing
   list. Corresponding mails will be silently ignored, correspondent
   posts will be removed from the mailing list archive without
   notification.

Contribute with patches

   Patches are welcome, preferably unified context diffs created this way
   (if you're familiar with CVS, you should use the [13]CVS repository
   and create patches with CVS):
  cd Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched
  make realclean
  cd ..
  diff -urN Video-DVDRip-0.48.2 Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched > patchfile.txt

   where Video-DVDRip-0.48.2 is the root directory of the original
   distribution and Video-DVDRip-0.48.2.patched your modified version.
   Without the make realclean all files created during make are added to
   the patch, what's not what we want.

If it simply works

   If dvd::rip works for you without any problems and you like it, don't
   hesitate to drop a mail. Next to all those problem and bug reports
   some positive postings delight every coders heart ;)

   Revision history and release notes for dvd::rip.

   0.97.4 [unstable branch] Sun Oct 30 2005, joern
    Bugfixes:
    - Various critical cluster mode fixes (in particular some
      endless loop conditions)
    - Subtitle preview didn't work due to conflicts with
      latest internal API changes.
    - dvd::rip rejected negative vertical subtitle offsets,
      which are absolutely valid. Thanks for the report to
      elerran <elerran AT freemail.gr>.
    - Fixed bug with wrong audio track assignment with
      old tcprobe based TOC reading (new lsdvd mode was not
      affected). Thanks for the report to Markus Frisch
      <markus AT frisch.com>
    - Volume scanning progress bar didn't work; scanned value
      didn't appear in GUI. Thanks for the report to
      Triffid Hunter.
    - dvdrip-tet crashed if a confirmation request should
      pop up. For know dvdrip-tet just assumes "Yes" to
      the question and continues.
