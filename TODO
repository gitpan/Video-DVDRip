KNOWN BUGS
- cluster mode

  - still avimerge progress problems. GUI freezes sometimes
    but merging does work Ok.
  - problems with avimerge and very small chunks? (not verified yet)

- cluster mode:
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - enhance chunk calculation (e.g. min: number of idle nodes)
  - test mode, which checks if a node is configured correctly:
    - does file system access work
