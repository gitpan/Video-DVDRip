KNOWN BUGS:
- Some DVDs can confuse the TOC reading algorithm of dvd::rip. First
  the titles are determined simply by reading the directory listing
  of the mounted DVD. Then tcprobe is called on each title number
  to gather detailed information of the corresponding video and audio
  streams. But tcprobe (probably due to a bug in the underlying
  libdvdread) sometimes permutes the title information, so a 5000 MB
  title appears with 500 frames and vice versa.
  
  This is no problem, if the swapped tracks have similar audio channels
  so you can choose the correct audio channel number in the apperently wrong
  title. When you rip such a track, the progress bar does not work correctly,
  because it relies on the scanned title size. But the ripping itself
  and the following transcode process are successful.
  
  If this does not work for you, you can edit the saved dvd::rip project
  file and correct the entries by hand. This is currently undocumented, but
  the project file is somewhat human readable, so give it a try.
  
  I think this is not really a dvd::rip bug, because tcprobe (or libdvdread)
  should report proper title information. But I noted this in my bug list,
  because it can be very confusing, and you should know about it ;)
  
  BTW: xine plays such DVDs without problems and displays the correct
       title number. This helps determining the correct title number.

TODO
- extensive checking of user input. most input is currently
  passed through without examination.
- exact letterbox autodetection
- button for vieweing the generated transcode command
- create personal clip&zoom preferences

DONE
- works not with Perl 5.005, but it should (fixed in 0.22)
- problems with automounter. check if the dvd is already mounted
  should fix the problem (fixed in 0.22)
- use fast resizing, when transcode hsize bug is fixed (done in 0.22)
- support multipass DivX encoding (done in 0.22)
