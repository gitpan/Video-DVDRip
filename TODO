KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- cluster mode
  - cluster control daemon leaks memory
- negative cropping isn't visualized in the preview image
  (all calculations and the transcoding itself work, so
   it's not that big problem ;)
- Autoadjust presets don't work if black bars can't be
  autodetected correctly, because the image itself is
  mostly black.
- cluster mode: on FreeBSD pstree's output looks different,
  so stopping jobs doesn't work on FreeBSD. Should use some
  Perl modules instead. Reported by Lukas Ertl <l.ertl AT
  univie.ac.at>

NOTE:
=====
The todo list beyond is my "notebook" for good ideas and
suggestions, which would be senseful or fun to implement
somedays. You see: this list is rather long. Some features
may be implented soon, some eventually never... ;)

TODO:
=====
- probe audio on the ripped VOB data. Some DVD's report wrong
  information when probed from the DVD.
- xvid properties window as a frontend for the xvid.cfg file,
  suggested by Edouard Gomez <ed.gomez AT wanadoo.fr>
- command line switches for immediate start of transcoding
  (opt. with splitting) a project. Simple batching is
  possible this way. Suggested by Rainer Lay
- print actual bits/pixel somewhere on the clip&zoom tab,
  suggested by Florin Andrei
- use tccat -P instead of -T if chapter mode is disabled,
  suggested by Sven Hartge (under investigation)
- add (S)VCD support to cluster mode
- add multi audio support to (S)VCD mode
- add additionals VCD presets, which doesn't clip the width,
  requested by Dave Van Dijck <dvandijck AT connect.be>
- warn (S)VCD rip's with illegal frame sizes, suggested by Rainer Lay
- pre-define user defaults for all clip & zoom and transcode parameters
  in a special project .rip file located in the user's home directory.
  The file can be loaded, all parameters changed, and saved. Future
  projects will take their default parameters from this file.
- add proper disc size presets for (S)VCD
- pcm passthrough
  -y (video codec),raw -N 0x1 (remove -b), requested by
  Jamie Manley <jamie AT homebrewcomputing.com> and
  <xercist AT xernet.lammah.com>
- support rendering subtitles
- add ogg/vorbis support
- preset a reasonably default value for the project data directory
  on first startup, suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- add some explantation to all those codecs to the docs
  (divx4/divx5/xvid/xvidcvs etc.)
- open preference window on 1st startup (if ~/.dvdriprc isn't there)
- button for deletion of VOB's and temp files,
  suggested by Robert NEMKIN <buci AT buci.hu>
- add preference "default clip&zoom preset"
- copy IFO files to HD, suggested by Magnus Sandin <magnus AT sandin.cx>
- preference for standard additional transcode options,
  suggested by Uwe Ade <uwe.ade AT gmx.de>
- lock project file to prevent multiple instances of the
  same project at the same time, suggested by Sven Hartge
- localize the GUI
- transcode the movie twice, if the divergence of the avi size
  is too big. Decrease/Increase the video bitrate according to
  the divergence in the second run. Suggested by Stefan Raspl
  <stefan.raspl AT playofmind.net>
- speed up 2pass transcoding with hq resizing by using fast
  resizing in the 1st pass. Suggested by Magnus Sandin <magnus AT sandin.cx>
- cluster mode
  - assign "preferred job types" to nodes, for speed optimizing. e.g.
    pass 1 jobs should be done by fast nodes, pass 2 by slow
    nodes to prevent fast nodes from waiting on slow nodes.
    Based on a suggestion from Markus Liebl
  - cleanup all files in tmp/ and cluster/ if VOB cleanup is
    enabled. Suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - no VOB cleanup if AVI size > requested size,
    suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - optimization of date intensive jobs doesn't check if
    there is at least one node with local access. Reported by
    Marek Malcherek <Malcherek AT Fh-Worms.DE>
  - implement alternatives for fping
    - make path customizable
    - provide a wrapper which uses GNU ping, but behaves like
      fping
    - replace fping by a Perl module but give the user the
      choice which to use
    Based on a suggestion from Greg McLearn <glmclear AT
    plg2.math.uwaterloo.ca>
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
- check file access rights before operation (ripping, transcoding etc.)
- print "ETA: not computable" for chapter ripping instead of
  a 100% progress bar, suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- chapter mode: check if preview frame # is available in 1st
  chapter and print better error message, suggested by
  Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- add rewind (1/10/60 seconds) buttons to preview frame # entry,
  suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- add a 'about' window with all important information, inclduing
  on how to send bug reports, suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- enable transcode's debugging mode (-q 2) and collect messages
  in a specific logfile (suggested by Florin Andrei)
- log some statistics after transcoding (e.g. avi size, actual bitrate,
  total time, total CPU time, sysload...), suggested by Florin Andrei
- add a preference option whether dvd::rip project data files
  should be saved in the project directory by default,
  suggested by Davide Ferrari
- option for disabling audio processing completely, suggested by
  <xercist AT xernet.lammah.com>
- export some sort of Makefile export for transcoding as a
  simple batch mode, suggested by Moritz Bunkus <moritz AT bunkus.org>
- option for forking the transcode process into the background,
  suggested by Akos Maroy <darkeye AT tyrell.hu>
- support smartdeinter filter, suggested by Christian Lambert
- support for transcode's -r option for fast frame bisection
  (and very fast deinterlacing)
- check for negative nice value if not run as root
- merge chapter avi's in two modes: all into one file,
  or adjacent chapters in separate files. Suggested by
  Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- enable video bitrate calculation for chapter mode
- enable pausing after 1st pass of a two-pass divx4 encoding,
  suggested by Chris <chris AT axique.de>.
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
- check space on filesystem before ripping and transcoding
- extensive checking of user input. most input is currently
  passed through without examination
- audio resampling, suggested by Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- create personal clip&zoom preferences
