KNOWN BUGS:
- The bug described below should be fixed by a new transcode patch for
  0.5.2 and 0.6.0pre1. Please download and install this patch from
  the transcode homepage.

  Some DVDs can confuse the TOC reading algorithm of dvd::rip. First
  the titles are determined simply by reading the directory listing
  of the mounted DVD. Then tcprobe is called on each title number
  to gather detailed information of the corresponding video and audio
  streams. But tcprobe (probably due to a bug in the underlying
  libdvdread) sometimes permutes the title information, so a 5000 MB
  title appears with 500 frames and vice versa.
  
  To workaround this, there is a text entry on the "RIP Title" tab.
  Select the track with the correct size and enter the title number
  with the correct tcprobe information.
  
  I think this is not really a dvd::rip bug, because tcprobe (or libdvdread)
  should report proper title information. But I noted this in my bug list,
  because it can be very confusing, and you should know about it ;)
  
  BTW: xine plays such DVDs without problems and displays the correct
       title number. This helps determining the correct title number.

TODO
- enable debugging mode by menu
- generic transcode option text entry (with override of parameters
  already added by dvd::rip)
- chapter mode ripping, requested by Norbert Preining
- rip without audio scanning
- extensive checking of user input. most input is currently
  passed through without examination
- calculate and show real aspect ratio of all processing steps,
  particularly needed for the fast resize option
- on the fly ripping & transcoding, requested by many users ;)
- bypass tcprobe mode, if tcprobe is unable to analyze the DVD correctly,
  requested by XI <xizard AT enib.fr>. Probably obsolete due to bugfix
  in tcprobe.
- exact letterbox autodetection
- create personal clip&zoom preferences
- mplayer support
- VCD and SVCD support (transcode 0.6.x), requested by
  George Farris <george AT gmsys.com>
