KNOWN BUGS
- cluster mode
  - cluster control daemon leaks memory
- canceling a transcode process (in standard mode) kills all
  transcode processes, in case of several dvd::rip instances
  are started. Reported by Torsten Howard <torsten AT inetw.net>
- negative cropping isn't visualized in the preview image
  (all calculations and the transcoding itself work, so
   it's not that big problem ;)
- Jure Pecar <pegasus AT telemach.net> reported a bug with
  endless operation in while ripping multiple titles. I currently
  can't reproduce it, but I'll keep an eye on it ;)
- "make test" complains about missing "splitpipe" on first time
  installation, if user doesn't have "." in PATH
- transcode long options are not supported by the transcode
  options field

TODO
- checkbox for --a52_drc_off, suggested by Christian Lambert.
- cluster mode
  - cleanup all files in tmp/ and cluster/ if VOB cleanup is
    enabled. Suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - no VOB cleanup if AVI size > requested size,
    suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - verify double audio problem reported by Philippe <sweafty AT free.fr>
- add a preference option whether dvd::rip project data files
  should be saved in the project directory by default,
  suggested by Davide Ferrari
- add a dvd::rip window manager icon
- export some sort of Makefile export for transcoding as a
  simple batch mode, suggested by Moritz Bunkus <moritz AT bunkus.org>
- support transcodes new --psu mode to solve NTSC sync problems
- set $frame_cnt/2 as default for frame grabber, suggested by
  Michael Dodwell <elmer AT trellian.com>
- option for forking the transcode process into the background,
  suggested by Akos Maroy <darkeye AT tyrell.hu>
- support generating multilanguage AVIs
- support smartdeinter filter, suggested by Christian Lambert
- support rendering subtitles
- support for transcode's -r option for fast frame bisection
  (and very fast deinterlacing)
- autosave function (after ripping, every X seconds or something)
- check for negative nice value if not run as root
- merge chapter avi's in two modes: all into one file,
  or adjacent chapters in separate files. Suggested by
  Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- make video player customizable, requested by Guillaume Rousse
  <rousse AT ccr.jussieu.fr>
- enable video bitrate calculation for chapter mode
- global preference for warning width divisible by 16 or 32 violations,
  suggested by Christian Lambert
- cluster mode:
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
- textfield for arbitrary command execution after transcoding,
  e.g. for system shutdown. Suggested by simbolo <simbolo225@yahoo.com>
- enable pausing after 1st pass of a two-pass divx4 encoding,
  suggested by Chris <chris AT axique.de>.
- enable dvd::rip to work on already existent VOB copies
  in filesystem
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
- check space on filesystem before ripping and transcoding
- extensive checking of user input. most input is currently
  passed through without examination
- on the fly ripping & transcoding (very low priority, most likely
  never implemented)
- audio resampling, suggested by Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- create personal clip&zoom preferences
- double check ripped data for correct audio streams
  (needed in seldom cases for ugly DVDs which lie about
   the audio streams with tcprobe from DVD)
