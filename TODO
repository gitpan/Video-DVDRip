KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- cluster mode:
  In the cluster control, let us say there are 6 tasks, 3 waiting, 3
  scheduled & being done.  Once they are done, the 3 are marked as
  finished, now click on the first finished and remove it. The second
  finished is being marked, remove it, the first task is being removed
  instead of the finished one.(reported by Lethal Weapon)
- selecting (S)VCD container type, triggers SVCD video
  codec, but doesn't set the SVCD type on the burning page.
  Reported by mark <Xebeque AT gmx.de>
- Ripping and snapshot grabbing fails if the title has no
  audio at all. Reported by Sean Dwyer <ewe2 AT can.org.au>.
- negative cropping isn't visualized in the preview image
  (all calculations and the transcoding itself work, so
   it's not that big problem ;)
- free diskspace calculation doesn't reflect a frame range selection
  and is wrong in chapter mode

NOTE:
=====
The todo list beyond is my "notebook" for good ideas and
suggestions, which would be senseful or fun to implement
somedays. You see: this list is rather long. Some features
may be implemented soon, some eventually never... ;)

TODO:
=====
- .dvdrip-info file should list filters. Suggested by Götz Waschk.
- support multiple subtitles in the same vobsub file
- make frame range transcoding with cluster mode possible:
  transcode the whole thing and cut the desired frames
  afterwards (before splitting). Suggested by Jens Carsten
  Hansen <greylion AT gmx.net>
- add a preference option whether dvd::rip project data files
  should be saved in the project directory by default,
  suggested by Davide Ferrari
- add a include dir for burning, suggested by Florin Andrei
- Make creating vcd11 images possible (e.g. by not overiding a
  --type=vcd11 setting in the preferences). Suggested by
  "Eric Fether" <efether AT rwconsulting.com>
- generic target aspect ratio mechanism: user can provide an arbitrary
  target aspect ratio (e.g. 1:1, 12:11, 16:11, 10:11 and 40:33)
  All autoadjusting presets take that into account (currently they
  always produce 1:1 ratio). Suggested by Christoph Lampert
  <chl AT math.uni-bonn.de>
- check for fat32 file system and warn, that files may not get
  larger than 2 GB (and suggest to use unix filsystems instead ;)
  Sugested by Felix Knecht.
- detect interlaced material (-J 32detect). Suggested by Rafael
  Kolless <rafael AT mondoria.de>
- check chapter mode && diskspace calculations
- add an "uninstall HOWTO" to the FAQ
- global nice preference, which apply to all started processes.
  It's not necessary to adjust this per project. Suggested by
  Spencer Ogden.
- video bitrate calculation: use runtime instead of frames/framerate
  for full encodings, because the frames/framerate formular doesn't
  work for NTSC movies with mixed frame rates. Reported by
  John Washington <jawashin AT uiuc.edu>.
- possibility of stopping transcoding after 1st pass, continue
  the 2nd pass later. Suggested by Christoph Lampert.
- drop constant 6GB per disc guess for ripping free disc space
  calculation. Use (total disk used/total number of frames)*title's
  number of frames instead. Suggested by Ole Tange.
- transcode all selected titles on the rip tab in a row,
  suggested by James Dowlearn <alwjdd AT utdallas.edu>
- on-the-fly/dvd-image mode: rip a small ammount to harddisk, to get ac3
  probing and passthrough working.
- CVD support, suggested by James L. Paul <james AT mauibay.net>
- enable (S)VCD interlaced encoding: add -F "-I 1", and remove "-p".
  Suggested by Ian Eure <ieure AT blarg.net>
- subtitle: enter subtitle id by hand, in case of badly probed DVD.
  Suggested by Mats Högberg <mitt.namn AT telia.com>.
- AVI: pause/resume for transcode job (using frame range trancoding
  and avimerge)
- link ETA compution of a 2-pass transcode together, requested by Ole Tange.
- add a DVD profile, Suggested by Felix Maibaum <f.maibaum AT tu-bs.de>
- support vobsub generation with cluster mode
- delete a file selection on the burn tab, requested by Tony Clark
  <tclark AT bredband.net>
- rename files on burn tab. Suggested by Christoph Bartoschek.
- entry for filename addition, to distinguish rips of the same title,
  with different settings. Suggested by Christoph Bartoschek.
- check and print diskspace for VOB/AVI directories separately.
  Suggested by Bodo Bauer <bb AT bb-zone.com>
- overall video bitrate calculation for a collection of
  selected titles. Requested by Felix Knecht <felixknecht AT web.de>
- print actual bits/pixel somewhere on the clip&zoom tab,
  suggested by Florin Andrei
- probe audio on the ripped VOB data. Some DVD's report wrong
  information when probed from the DVD.
- xvid properties window as a frontend for the xvid.cfg file,
  suggested by Edouard Gomez <ed.gomez AT wanadoo.fr>
- add (S)VCD support to cluster mode
- pre-define user defaults for all clip & zoom and transcode parameters
  in a special project .rip file located in the user's home directory.
  The file can be loaded, all parameters changed, and saved. Future
  projects will take their default parameters from this file.
- button for deletion of VOB's and temp files,
  suggested by Robert Nemkin <buci AT buci.hu>
- add preference "default clip&zoom preset"
- preference for standard additional transcode options,
  suggested by Uwe Ade <uwe.ade AT gmx.de>
- lock project file to prevent multiple instances of the
  same project at the same time, suggested by Sven Hartge
- localize the GUI
- transcode the movie twice, if the divergence of the avi size
  is too big. Decrease/Increase the video bitrate according to
  the divergence in the second run. Suggested by Stefan Raspl
  <stefan.raspl AT playofmind.net>
- cluster mode
  - assign "preferred job types" to nodes, for speed optimizing. e.g.
    pass 1 jobs should be done by fast nodes, pass 2 by slow
    nodes to prevent fast nodes from waiting on slow nodes.
    Based on a suggestion from Markus Liebl
  - cleanup all files in tmp/ and cluster/ if VOB cleanup is
    enabled. Suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - no VOB cleanup if AVI size > requested size,
    suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - optimization of date intensive jobs doesn't check if
    there is at least one node with local access. Reported by
    Marek Malcherek <Malcherek AT Fh-Worms.DE>
  - implement alternatives for fping
    - make path customizable
    - provide a wrapper which uses GNU ping, but behaves like
      fping
    - replace fping by a Perl module but give the user the
      choice which to use
    Based on a suggestion from Greg McLearn <glmclear AT
    plg2.math.uwaterloo.ca>
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
- check file access rights before operation (ripping, transcoding etc.)
- chapter mode: check if preview frame # is available in 1st
  chapter and print better error message, suggested by
  Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- add a 'about' window with all important information, including
  on how to send bug reports, suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- enable transcode's debugging mode (-q 2) and collect messages
  in a specific logfile (suggested by Florin Andrei)
- log some statistics after transcoding (e.g. avi size, actual bitrate,
  total time, total CPU time, sysload...), suggested by Florin Andrei
- support for transcode's -r option for fast frame bisection
  (and very fast deinterlacing)
- check for negative nice value if not run as root
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
