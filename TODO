KNOWN BUGS
- cluster mode
  - cluster control daemon leaks memory
  - still avimerge progress problems. GUI freezes sometimes
    but merging does work Ok.
  - problems with avimerge and very small chunks? (not verified yet)
- transcode didn't accept YUV mode with odd frame sizes, so
  dvd::rip shouldn't either

TODO
- cluster mode:
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - enhance chunk calculation (e.g. min: number of idle nodes)
  - checkbox for reducing the bitrate about a few precent to
    prevent a slightly bigger result, which can happen because
    the bitrate estimation tends to bigger files on small chunks.
- documentation
  - cluster mode ssh issues, inspired by a report from
    Douglas Bollinger
- support DVDs with pcm encoded audio
- check out if pgmfindclip is useful for dvd::rip
- display a status of the selected title
  - ripped
  - preview grabbed
  - transcoded
- textfield for arbitrary command execution after transcoding,
  e.g. for system shutdown. Suggested by simbolo <simbolo225@yahoo.com>
- enable dvd::rip to work on already existent VOB copies
  in filesystem, suggested by flier <flier AT scrollz.com>
- enable pausing after 1st pass of a two-pass divx4 encoding,
  suggested by Chris <chris AT axique.de>.
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
- support generating multilanguage AVIs
- rip multiple titles in batch mode, suggested by Hrvoje Husic
  <husic AT zyn.de>
- show div8 exclamation marks only in clip2 stage
- provide avimerge option in chapter mode
- check space on filesystem before ripping and transcoding
- changing sample rate, suggested by Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- selection box for supported video codecs, suggested by Certron DiSoni
- avisplit in chapter mode
- extensive checking of user input. most input is currently
  passed through without examination
- enable debugging mode by menu
- calculate and show real aspect ratio of all processing steps,
  particularly needed for the fast resize option
- on the fly ripping & transcoding, requested by many users ;)
- create personal clip&zoom preferences
- mplayer support
- VCD and SVCD support (transcode 0.6.x)
