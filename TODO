KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- cluster mode
  - cluster control daemon leaks memory
- cluster mode: on FreeBSD pstree's output looks different,
  so stopping jobs doesn't work on FreeBSD. Should use some
  Perl modules instead. Reported by Lukas Ertl <l.ertl AT
  univie.ac.at>

- Ripping and snapshot grabbing fails if the title has no
  audio at all. Reported by Sean Dwyer <ewe2 AT can.org.au>.
- negative cropping isn't visualized in the preview image
  (all calculations and the transcoding itself work, so
   it's not that big problem ;)
- check chapter mode && diskspace calculations

NOTE:
=====
The todo list beyond is my "notebook" for good ideas and
suggestions, which would be senseful or fun to implement
somedays. You see: this list is rather long. Some features
may be implemented soon, some eventually never... ;)

TODO:
=====
- add an "uninstall HOWTO" to the FAQ
- write error messages of executed tools in dvd::rip's log.
  Suggested by Felix Enning <felix AT hfsclub.de>.
- global nice preference, which apply to all started processes.
  It's not necessary to adjust this per project. Suggested by
  Spencer Ogden.
- drop constant 6GB per disc guess for ripping free disc space
  calculation. Use (total disk used/total number of frames)*title's
  number of frames instead. Suggested by Ole Tange.
- transcode all selected titles on the rip tab in a row,
  suggested by James Dowlearn <alwjdd AT utdallas.edu>
- on-the-fly/dvd-image mode: rip a small ammount to harddisk, to get ac3
  probing and passthrough working.
- AVI: pause/resume for transcode job (using frame range trancoding
  and avimerge)
- link ETA compution of a 2-pass transcode together, requested by Ole Tange.
- add a DVD profile, Suggested by Felix Maibaum <f.maibaum AT tu-bs.de>
- mplayer aid parameter must be codec specific. Thanks for
  the report to Fabio Russo.
- support multiple subtitles in the same vobsub file
- support vobsub generation with cluster mode
- delete a file selection on the burn tab, requested by Tony Clark
  <tclark AT bredband.net>
- rename files on burn tab. Suggested by Christoph Bartoschek.
- entry for filename addition, to distinguish rips of the same title,
  with different settings. Suggested by Christoph Bartoschek.
- check and print diskspace for VOB/AVI directories separately.
  Suggested by Bodo Bauer <bb AT bb-zone.com>
- consider avi/ogg containter overhead when calculating the
  video bitrate, suggested by Markus Liebl
- overall video bitrate calculation for a collection of
  selected titles. Requested by Felix Knecht <felixknecht AT web.de>
- print actual bits/pixel somewhere on the clip&zoom tab,
  suggested by Florin Andrei
- probe audio on the ripped VOB data. Some DVD's report wrong
  information when probed from the DVD.
- xvid properties window as a frontend for the xvid.cfg file,
  suggested by Edouard Gomez <ed.gomez AT wanadoo.fr>
- add (S)VCD support to cluster mode
- pre-define user defaults for all clip & zoom and transcode parameters
  in a special project .rip file located in the user's home directory.
  The file can be loaded, all parameters changed, and saved. Future
  projects will take their default parameters from this file.
- button for deletion of VOB's and temp files,
  suggested by Robert Nemkin <buci AT buci.hu>
- add preference "default clip&zoom preset"
- preference for standard additional transcode options,
  suggested by Uwe Ade <uwe.ade AT gmx.de>
- lock project file to prevent multiple instances of the
  same project at the same time, suggested by Sven Hartge
- localize the GUI
- transcode the movie twice, if the divergence of the avi size
  is too big. Decrease/Increase the video bitrate according to
  the divergence in the second run. Suggested by Stefan Raspl
  <stefan.raspl AT playofmind.net>
- cluster mode
  - assign "preferred job types" to nodes, for speed optimizing. e.g.
    pass 1 jobs should be done by fast nodes, pass 2 by slow
    nodes to prevent fast nodes from waiting on slow nodes.
    Based on a suggestion from Markus Liebl
  - cleanup all files in tmp/ and cluster/ if VOB cleanup is
    enabled. Suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - no VOB cleanup if AVI size > requested size,
    suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - optimization of date intensive jobs doesn't check if
    there is at least one node with local access. Reported by
    Marek Malcherek <Malcherek AT Fh-Worms.DE>
  - implement alternatives for fping
    - make path customizable
    - provide a wrapper which uses GNU ping, but behaves like
      fping
    - replace fping by a Perl module but give the user the
      choice which to use
    Based on a suggestion from Greg McLearn <glmclear AT
    plg2.math.uwaterloo.ca>
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
- check file access rights before operation (ripping, transcoding etc.)
- chapter mode: check if preview frame # is available in 1st
  chapter and print better error message, suggested by
  Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- add a 'about' window with all important information, including
  on how to send bug reports, suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- enable transcode's debugging mode (-q 2) and collect messages
  in a specific logfile (suggested by Florin Andrei)
- log some statistics after transcoding (e.g. avi size, actual bitrate,
  total time, total CPU time, sysload...), suggested by Florin Andrei
- add a preference option whether dvd::rip project data files
  should be saved in the project directory by default,
  suggested by Davide Ferrari
- support for transcode's -r option for fast frame bisection
  (and very fast deinterlacing)
- check for negative nice value if not run as root
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
