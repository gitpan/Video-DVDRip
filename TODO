KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- cluster mode
  - cluster control daemon leaks memory
- canceling a transcode process (in standard mode) kills all
  transcode processes, in case of several dvd::rip instances
  are started. Reported by Torsten Howard <torsten AT inetw.net>
- negative cropping isn't visualized in the preview image
  (all calculations and the transcoding itself work, so
   it's not that big problem ;)

NOTE:
=====
The todo list beyond is my "notebook" for good ideas and
suggestions, which would be senseful or fun to implement
somedays. You see: this list is rather long. Some features
may be implented soon, some eventually never... ;)

TODO:
=====
- support generating multilanguage AVIs
- support rendering subtitles
- use tccat -P instead of -T if chapter mode is disabled,
  suggested by Sven Hartge
- autosave function (after ripping, every X seconds or something)
- lock project file to prevent multiple instances of the
  same project at the same time, suggested by Sven Hartge
- localize the GUI
- cluster mode
  - cleanup all files in tmp/ and cluster/ if VOB cleanup is
    enabled. Suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - no VOB cleanup if AVI size > requested size,
    suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - optimization of date intensive jobs doesn't check if
    there is at least one node with local access. Reported by
    Marek Malcherek <Malcherek AT Fh-Worms.DE>
  - implement alternatives for fping
    - make path customizable
    - provide a wrapper which uses GNU ping, but behaves like
      fping
    - replace fping by a Perl module but give the user the
      choice which to use
    Based on a suggestion from Greg McLearn <glmclear AT
    plg2.math.uwaterloo.ca>
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
- check file access rights before operation (ripping, transcoding etc.)
- enable transcode's debugging mode (-q 2) and collect messages
  in a specific logfile (suggested by Florin Andrei)
- log some statistics after transcoding (e.g. avi size, actual bitrate,
  total time, total CPU time, sysload...), suggested by Florin Andrei
- add checkbox "exit after transcoding" which saves the project
  and exits after transcoding. Suggested by Florin Andrei
- pcm passthrough
- add a preference option whether dvd::rip project data files
  should be saved in the project directory by default,
  suggested by Davide Ferrari
- option for disabling audio processing completely, suggested by
  <xercist AT xernet.lammah.com>
- enable dvd::rip to work on already existent VOB copies in filesystem
- add a dvd::rip window manager icon, suggested by Florin Andrei
- export some sort of Makefile export for transcoding as a
  simple batch mode, suggested by Moritz Bunkus <moritz AT bunkus.org>
- option for forking the transcode process into the background,
  suggested by Akos Maroy <darkeye AT tyrell.hu>
- support smartdeinter filter, suggested by Christian Lambert
- support for transcode's -r option for fast frame bisection
  (and very fast deinterlacing)
- check for negative nice value if not run as root
- merge chapter avi's in two modes: all into one file,
  or adjacent chapters in separate files. Suggested by
  Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- enable video bitrate calculation for chapter mode
- textfield for arbitrary command execution after transcoding,
  e.g. for system shutdown. Suggested by simbolo <simbolo225 AT yahoo.com>
  - add checkbox for executing in a xterm, suggested by Florin Andrei
- enable pausing after 1st pass of a two-pass divx4 encoding,
  suggested by Chris <chris AT axique.de>.
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
- check space on filesystem before ripping and transcoding
- extensive checking of user input. most input is currently
  passed through without examination
- on the fly ripping & transcoding (very low priority, most likely
  never implemented)
- audio resampling, suggested by Certron DiSoni <certron_80 AT yahoo.com>
- create personal clip&zoom preferences
- double check ripped data for correct audio streams
  (needed in seldom cases for ugly DVDs which lie about
   the audio streams with tcprobe from DVD)
