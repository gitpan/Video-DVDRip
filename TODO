KNOWN BUGS:
===========

- Ripping multiple titles in a row: no preview grabbing for all
  titles but the first. Reported by Uwe Dippel <udippel AT uniten.edu.my>.
- realtime subtitle preview resp. subtitling in general doesn't
  work in RGB colorspace. dvd::rip should warn about this, when
  clip&zoom parameters has odd values which force RGB colorspace,
  but user still tries to render subtitles.
- xvid4.conf is ignored in cluster mode. Reported by
  Ron <ron AT ron-kitten.net>
- shutting down dvd::rip on the logging tab is slow. Reported
  by Christoph Lampert.
- vobsub creation fails on vfat partitions. Reported by
  Christoph Lampert.
- creating vobsub after transcoding doesn't work for (S)VCD
  (it's useless anyway, but dvd::rip should warn about this).
  Thanks to Kai Bartels <kaba AT picturesafe.de>.
- NTSC frame rate issue, reported by Frank Sigi' Luithle
  <sigi AT fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de>:
  I just found that auto-corrected frame-rates from wrongly detected NTSC
  movies are not transferred into the FPS drop-down in the 'Transcode' tab.
  According to Changelog for 0.50.11 this was a workaround for a transcode
  bug.  Actually the correct frame-rate is shown in the 'Rip' tab, so the
  workaround seems to be OK.  Unfortunately the incorrect framerate still
  appears under 'Video framerate' in the 'Transcode' tab.
  If one forgets to correct this by hand, one gets incorrectly encoded videos
  (in my case audio lag was the result).  This is quite annoying since you
  wouldn't find out until the final video is encoded...

NOTE:
=====
The todo list beyond is my "notebook" for good ideas and
suggestions, which would be senseful or fun to implement
somedays. You see: this list is rather long. Some features
may be implemented soon, some eventually never... ;)

TODO:
=====
- mplayer command: placeholder for the configured DVD device
  (mplayer option -dvd-device). Suggested by Sunny <sloncho AT gmail.com>.
- add preference "default clip&zoom preset", suggested by
  Uwe Dippel <udippel AT uniten.edu.my>.
- pre-define user defaults for all clip & zoom and transcode parameters
  in a special project .rip file located in the user's home directory.
  The file can be loaded, all parameters changed, and saved. Future
  projects will take their default parameters from this file.
- print actual bits/pixel somewhere on the clip&zoom tab,
  suggested by Florin Andrei
- Do "ls /dvdmountpoint" instead of mounting it if an automounter
  is in action. Probably need to be configured in the Preferences
  dialog. Suggested by Sunny <sloncho AT gmail.com>.
- scan all audio tracks during ripping, suggested by Ole Tange.
- subtitle preview: interactive subtitle positioning feature, suggested
  by Benjamin Van Laere <B.VanLaere AT unpeu.com>
- allow mono audio
- make transcode's -H option configurable to solve A/V sync
  problems with some material. Suggested by Wayne Hogue
  <mythtv AT chiphead.net>
- integration of HTML base help into dvd::rip, suggested by
  Jacques Ferré <ferre-jacques AT wanadoo.fr>
- open a HOWTO section in the documentation, starting with
  Gunnar's <gunix AT comhem.se> HOWTO for a quick rip including
  subtitles.
- support transcode's --export_par option, requested by Jim Darby
  <jim AT jimbocorp.uklinux.net>
- interactive video frame selection on clip&zoom page, requested
  by Florian Erfurthh <floh-erfurth AT vodafone.de>
- extract/transcode additional sound tracks to an already
  transcoded movie.
- round split timestamp for splitted vobsubs, as long subtitleripper
  can't split at millisecond accuracy. Suggested by Jean-Yves Simon.
- add a template of the vobsub creation command to debugging window,
  suggested by Christoph Lampert.
- vobsub: use fractional values for splitting, suggested by
  Jean-Yves Simon.
- make cluster webinterface fully interactive, requested by
  Stuecker, Sebastian <Stuecker AT nm.hsd.utc.com>
- add support for new pixel aspect ratio transcode feature (ffmpeg
  and xvid). Suggested by Christoph Lampert.
- generic target aspect ratio mechanism: user can provide an arbitrary
  target aspect ratio (e.g. 1:1, 12:11, 16:11, 10:11 and 40:33)
  All autoadjusting presets take that into account (currently they
  always produce 1:1 ratio). Suggested by Christoph Lampert
  <chl AT math.uni-bonn.de>
- add support for MPEG2 requantization (needs transcode 0.6.11
  or better) and basic DVD authoring.
- extra logfile for dvdrip-master, suggested by
  Martin Lohmeier <blackm AT ferris.dyndns.info>
- make list of video codecs on Transcode tab configurable.
  Suggested by Sven Gehr <sven AT dreampixel.de>
- support lame preset option resp. mp3/vbr audio
- a preference for default transcode options, suggested by Mark Rose.
- add eMoviX support, requested by Daniel Laska <dalas AT web.de>
- ffmpeg: store aspect ratio in AVI file (by ~/.transcode/ffmpeg.cfg),
  requested by Alessio Sangalli <alesan AT manoweb.com>, 27.08.2003
- .dvdrip-info file should list filters. Suggested by Götz Waschk.
- add support for mpeg2enc -q option to the GUI (requested by
  Simone Lehmann, 18.07.2003)
- support multiple subtitles in the same vobsub file
- make frame range transcoding with cluster mode possible:
  transcode the whole thing and cut the desired frames
  afterwards (before splitting). Suggested by Jens Carsten
  Hansen <greylion AT gmx.net>
- add a preference option whether dvd::rip project data files
  should be saved in the project directory by default,
  suggested by Davide Ferrari
- add a include dir for burning, suggested by Florin Andrei
- Make creating vcd11 images possible (e.g. by not overiding a
  --type=vcd11 setting in the preferences). Suggested by
  "Eric Fether" <efether AT rwconsulting.com>
- check for fat32 file system and warn, that files may not get
  larger than 2 GB (and suggest to use unix filsystems instead ;)
  Suggested by Felix Knecht.
- detect interlaced material (-J 32detect). Suggested by Rafael
  Kolless <rafael AT mondoria.de>
- global nice preference, which apply to all started processes.
  It's not necessary to adjust this per project. Suggested by
  Spencer Ogden.
- video bitrate calculation: use runtime instead of frames/framerate
  for full encodings, because the frames/framerate formular doesn't
  work for NTSC movies with mixed frame rates. Reported by
  John Washington <jawashin AT uiuc.edu>.
- drop constant 6GB per disc guess for ripping free disc space
  calculation. Use (total disk used/total number of frames)*title's
  number of frames instead. Suggested by Ole Tange.
- transcode all selected titles on the rip tab in a row,
  suggested by James Dowlearn <alwjdd AT utdallas.edu>
- on-the-fly/dvd-image mode: rip a small ammount to harddisk, to get ac3
  probing and passthrough working.
- enable (S)VCD interlaced encoding: add -F "-I 1", and remove "-p".
  Suggested by Ian Eure <ieure AT blarg.net>
- AVI: pause/resume for transcode job (using frame range trancoding
  and avimerge)
- link ETA compution of a 2-pass transcode together, requested by Ole Tange.
- add a DVD profile, Suggested by Felix Maibaum <f.maibaum AT tu-bs.de>
- support vobsub generation with cluster mode
- delete a file selection on the burn tab, requested by Tony Clark
  <tclark AT bredband.net>
- rename files on burn tab. Suggested by Christoph Bartoschek.
- entry for filename addition, to distinguish rips of the same title,
  with different settings. Suggested by Christoph Bartoschek.
- check and print diskspace for VOB/AVI directories separately.
  Suggested by Bodo Bauer <bb AT bb-zone.com>
- overall video bitrate calculation for a collection of
  selected titles. Requested by Felix Knecht <felixknecht AT web.de>
- probe audio on the ripped VOB data. Some DVD's report wrong
  information when probed from the DVD.
- xvid properties window as a frontend for the xvid.cfg file,
  suggested by Edouard Gomez <ed.gomez AT wanadoo.fr>
- add (S)VCD support to cluster mode
- button for deletion of VOB's and temp files,
  suggested by Robert Nemkin <buci AT buci.hu>
- preference for standard additional transcode options,
  suggested by Uwe Ade <uwe.ade AT gmx.de>
- lock project file to prevent multiple instances of the
  same project at the same time, suggested by Sven Hartge
- localize the GUI
- transcode the movie twice, if the divergence of the avi size
  is too big. Decrease/Increase the video bitrate according to
  the divergence in the second run. Suggested by Stefan Raspl
  <stefan.raspl AT playofmind.net>
- cluster mode
  - assign "preferred job types" to nodes, for speed optimizing. e.g.
    pass 1 jobs should be done by fast nodes, pass 2 by slow
    nodes to prevent fast nodes from waiting on slow nodes.
    Based on a suggestion from Markus Liebl
  - cleanup all files in tmp/ and cluster/ if VOB cleanup is
    enabled. Suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - no VOB cleanup if AVI size > requested size,
    suggested by Stefan Opsomer <stefan.opsomer AT wanadoo.be>
  - optimization of date intensive jobs doesn't check if
    there is at least one node with local access. Reported by
    Marek Malcherek <Malcherek AT Fh-Worms.DE>
  - implement alternatives for fping
    - make path customizable
    - provide a wrapper which uses GNU ping, but behaves like
      fping
    - replace fping by a Perl module but give the user the
      choice which to use
    Based on a suggestion from Greg McLearn <glmclear AT
    plg2.math.uwaterloo.ca>
  - schedule start/end time of a node, suggested by Rainer Lay
  - stop node after current job, suggested by Rainer Lay
- check file access rights before operation (ripping, transcoding etc.)
- chapter mode: check if preview frame # is available in 1st
  chapter and print better error message, suggested by
  Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- add a 'about' window with all important information, including
  on how to send bug reports, suggested by Ole Tange <tange AT tange.dk>
- enable transcode's debugging mode (-q 2) and collect messages
  in a specific logfile (suggested by Florin Andrei)
- log some statistics after transcoding (e.g. avi size, actual bitrate,
  total time, total CPU time, sysload...), suggested by Florin Andrei
- support for transcode's -r option for fast frame bisection
  (and very fast deinterlacing)
- check for negative nice value if not run as root
- don't rip chapters already ripped in chapter selection mode
